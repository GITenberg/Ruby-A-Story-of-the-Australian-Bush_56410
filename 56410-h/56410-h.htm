<p class="drop-cap">CHRISTMAS DAY in the Australian
bush! Not the sort of Christmas
Day we dwellers in bonnie Scotland
or merry England are accustomed
to. The sun is blazing down in remorseless
strength upon the parched ground, where the
few trees about the station cast so slight a
shadow. Past the foot of the straggling garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the little creek dances and ripples on its way
to the river, half a mile away, and, as far as
eye can reach, stretch the blue distances of
bush in long, monotonous undulation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wish he&#8217;d come,&#8221; says Ruby. &#8220;The pudding
will be quite cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>On such a day as this it does not seem of
paramount importance whether the pudding be
hot or cold. In fact, Christmas Day though it
be, it would be rather a relief to have a cold
pudding than otherwise.</p>

<p>Ruby&#8217;s anxious little face testifies that such is
not her opinion. She has come out to the verandah,
and, shading her eyes with her hand from the
white glare of the sun, gazes now this way, now
that. The pudding lies heavily upon her heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ruby!&#8221; comes a rather querulous voice from
the room beyond the shady blue blinds.</p>

<p>The little girl gives one last long glance in
every direction, then lets the shading hand drop,
and passes through the open doorway of the
pretty cottage which is Ruby&#8217;s home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he coming, Ruby?&#8221;</p>

<p>The yellow-haired woman lying on the sofa
is Ruby&#8217;s step-mother. The roses of the once
pretty pink cheeks have paled to white, and
there are fretful little lines about the corners of
the mouth, and a discontented expression in
the big blue eyes; but with it all Mrs. Thorne
has pretensions to beauty still.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>&#8220;He&#8217;s not in sight yet, mamma,&#8221; returns
Ruby, wrinkling up her brow. She calls Mrs.
Thorne &#8220;mamma,&#8221; for the fair-faced unaffectionate
woman is the only mother the child
has ever known. Ruby was only a baby when
her own mother died, and &#8220;mamma in heaven&#8221;
is a far less real personage to her little daughter
than &#8220;mamma&#8221; on earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very tiresome.&#8221; The lady&#8217;s tone is
peevish, and she fans herself languidly with a
large fan lying by her side. &#8220;I can&#8217;t conceive
what makes your father so irregular at mealtimes.
Do bring me something cool to drink,
Ruby, like a good child. This heat is intolerable.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;station&#8221; is built in a quadrangle, and
across one corner of this quadrangle Ruby has
to go ere she reaches the kitchen. If it is hot
in the living room, it is ten times hotter here,
where Jenny, a stout, buxom Scotchwoman of
forty or thereabouts, who for love of her mistress
has braved the loneliness of bush life, is busy
amidst her pots and pans getting ready the
Christmas dinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad&#8217;s not come yet, Jenny,&#8221; Ruby says as
she reaches down a tumbler and prepares the cooling
drink which her step-mother has requested.
&#8220;Do you think the pudding will keep all right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be none the waur if he&#8217;ll no be that
long,&#8221; Jenny returns, giving the fire a stir-up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
&#8220;I&#8217;d no mind the cookin&#8217; if it wasna&#8217; for the
heat; but the heat&#8217;s maist awfu&#8217;. It near sends
a body gyte. To think o&#8217; the Christmas they&#8217;ll
be havin&#8217; in Scotland too. It a&#8217;most gars me
greet to think o&#8217; it a&#8217;, Miss Ruby, and us awa&#8217;
in this queer-like place. It&#8217;s fine enough to say
that fortunes can be made out here; but I wad
rather dae wi&#8217;out the fortune an&#8217; stay at hame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, you see, this is home now,&#8221; Ruby says,
stirring up her decoction gravely. &#8220;That&#8217;s what
papa always says when mamma gets cross.
Mamma doesn&#8217;t like staying here, you see. She
says Scotland never seemed so bonnie as when
she&#8217;s away from it. And I&#8217;m Scotch, too.&#8221;
Ruby gives her head rather a proud little toss.
&#8220;But I call this home. But of course I don&#8217;t
remember Scotland&mdash;hardly,&#8221; the little girl
admits slowly.</p>

<p>The tumbler has received its final stir-up
now, and Ruby carries it through the blazing
sun of the courtyard to her step-mother, still
lying on the sofa.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fan you, mamma, while you&#8217;re drinking
it, and that&#8217;ll make you feel cooler.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, dear; you <i>are</i> a good little girl,&#8221;
her mother says, with an approving pat for the
small hand wielding the fan.</p>

<p>Ruby&#8217;s heart gives a great leap of joy. It
is so seldom that her step-mother speaks to her
like this. Not that Mrs. Thorne is unkind to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
her husband&#8217;s little daughter; but, wrapped up
in herself and her own ailments, she has but
small sympathy to waste on others. Had she
seen the gladness which shone out of the child&#8217;s
eyes at the unaccustomed words of kindness,
she might have spoken them oftener. Though
she loves her husband as much as it is possible
for such a nature to love any one, it has been
a bitter trial to Dora Thorne, reared midst the
refinements of a Scottish home, to leave friends
and kindred for his sake, and to exchange the
well-known, well-loved heather-hilled land of
her birth for the hardships and uncertainties
of the Australian bush. So perhaps it is no
wonder that her time is so taken up in commiserating
herself that she has but little leisure
left to commiserate or sympathize with any one
else.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ruby raises her head, a &#8220;listening&#8221;
look on her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s him!&#8221; she cries. &#8220;I hear him
coming now!&#8221;</p>

<p>The child rushes out to the verandah, and
again shades her eyes with her hand. Through
the sunlight, across the cleared space of grass
which surrounds the station, a horse and rider
are coming. With the sunny glare in her eyes,
it is not until he is quite near that Ruby sees
that the approaching figure really is her father.
Strangers do not come often to Glengarry; but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
so chances that now and again a stray traveller
on his way to the coast claims the hospitality
of the station.</p>

<p>He swings off his horse at the garden-gate,
flings the reins to Dick, the stable-boy, and
stoops to kiss the face of the little girl who has
run out to meet him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were just never coming, dad,&#8221;
complains Ruby, plaintively. &#8220;And Jenny&#8217;s
afraid the pudding&#8217;ll be spoilt. It&#8217;s been ready
ever so long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here I am at last anyway, little woman,&#8221;
laughs the big man, whose brown eyes are so
like Ruby&#8217;s, and whose voice is the sweetest
sound in the world to his little daughter.</p>

<p>He goes into the house, with the child hanging
upon his arm, her big eyes gazing up at him, reflecting
every smile in the dear face above her.
The love between those two is a very beautiful
thing, like that sweet old-fashioned love of which
we read, that it was &#8220;passing that of women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were never coming, Will,&#8221;
says his wife, giving vent to her thoughts in
the same words as Ruby. &#8220;You do look hot,
and no wonder; for it is hot enough even in
here. And I have <i>such</i> a headache.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor little Dolly!&#8221;</p>

<p>Surely a shade of regret passes over the
bronzed face as he strokes the soft golden hair
with his big rough hand. He is reproaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
himself that he has not been unselfish enough,
as many a man has, to face the battle alone,
instead of bringing this fragile little Dolly of his
away from the dear &#8220;kent faces&#8221; of the land
where she was born, to brave the rough life
and hardships of the Australian bush. And
before his eyes uprises another face&mdash;a young,
bright, dauntless face, with fearless grey eyes&mdash;the
the face of Ruby&#8217;s mother, who would have
gone through fire and water for the sake of
the man she loved; but who, in her quiet
Scottish home, had not been called upon to do
any great thing, only to leave her husband and
child when the King called her away to that
other land which is fairer even than the dearly
loved bonnie Scotland she left behind.</p>

<p>It is no one&#8217;s fault that the wrong woman
seems to have been put in the wrong place,
that the fearless Scottish lassie who would fain
have proved her love for her husband by
braving peril and hardship for his sake, had
comfortable circumstances and a peaceful life
for her lot, and that the fair-faced, ease-loving
woman who came after her should have had to
brave those very hardships which the first had
coveted.</p>

<p>To Ruby her own mother is nothing more
than a name, and Scotland itself not much
more. She was only three years old when the
new golden-haired mother came home, and but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
little more when the reverses followed which
forced her father to seek his fortune in an
unknown land over the sea. And Australia is
now, as Ruby has said to Jenny, &#8220;home.&#8221;</p>

<p>The child goes dancing off, and across the
sunshine of the quadrangle to tell Jenny to
bring the Christmas dinner in. It is a dinner
which is much too hot for an Australian bush
Christmas; but, if we happen to be Scottish, let
us be Scottish or die!</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have brought you out here,
Dolly,&#8221; the husband is saying. He has said
the same thing for the last half-dozen years;
but that does not mend matters, or bring the
faded pink back to his Dolly&#8217;s cheeks. But she
likes to hear him say it, poor little woman. It
shows that he sympathizes with those not
always imaginary ailments of hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll take me home again soon, Will,&#8221; she
coaxes, clinging to him. Unlike Ruby, far-away
Scotland is still home to Dora Thorne.
&#8220;Now that you are getting on so well. Just
for a little while to see them all. Couldn&#8217;t you
manage, Will?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No saying, darling,&#8221; he responds brightly.
He does not think it necessary to trouble this
fragile little wife of his with the knowledge
that things are not going on quite &#8220;so well&#8221;
at present as she seems to fancy. &#8220;Next
Christmas Day, God willing, we&#8217;ll try to spend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
in bonnie Scotland. That brings the roses to
your cheeks, little girl!&#8221;</p>

<p>It has brought the roses to her cheeks, the
light to her violet eyes. Dora Thorne looks
as young just now as she did one far-off June
day when she plighted her troth to the man of
her choice in the old parish kirk at home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you hear what papa says, Ruby?&#8221; she
says when they are all three sitting at dinner,
and the faintest breath of wind is stirring the
blue blinds gently. &#8220;That we are going to
Scotland for next Christmas Day, to dear
bonnie Scotland, with its heather and its bluebells.
I must write to the home people and
tell them to-night. How glad they all will be!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O-oh!&#8221; cries Ruby, with wide-open brown
eyes. Then, as another possibility dawns upon
her, &#8220;But am I to go too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we go, of course our little girl will go
with us,&#8221; her father assures her.</p>

<p>Christmas in Scotland! Ruby seems lost in
a happy dream. Scotland! the dear, unknown
land where she was born! The land, which to
mamma and Jenny is the one land of all, far
above all others!</p>

<p>&#8220;Will Jenny go too?&#8221; she inquires further.</p>

<p>The two elders look doubtfully at each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; says mamma at length rather
lamely. &#8220;Don&#8217;t say anything to her about it
just now, Ruby, till it is quite settled.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>Quite settled! In Ruby&#8217;s mind it is quite
settled already. She goes out to the verandah
after dinner, and, swinging idly in the hammock,
indulges in the luxury of dreaming. Above
her stretches the cloudless blue of the Australian
sky, for miles on her every hand lie the undulations
of Australian bush; but Ruby is far
away from it all, away in bonnie Scotland, with
its rippling burns and purple heather, away in
the land where her mother lived and died, and
where Ruby&#8217;s own baby eyes first opened.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about too good to be true,&#8221; the little
girl is thinking. &#8220;It&#8217;s like dreaming, and then
you waken from the dream and find it&#8217;s all just
a make-up. What if this was a dream too?&#8221;</p>

<p>It is not a dream, as Ruby finds after she
has dealt herself several sharp pinches, her most
approved method of demonstrating to herself
that reality really is reality. No dream, she
has found by experience, can long outlast such
treatment.</p>

<p>But by-and-by even reality passes into dreaming,
and Ruby goes to sleep, the rippling of
the creek in her ears, and the sunshine of the
Christmas afternoon falling aslant upon her face.</p>

<p>In her dreams the splash of the creek is
transformed into the babble of a Highland
burn over the stones, and the sunshine is the
sunshine of dear, unknown, bonnie Scotland.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">RUBY always remembers the day that
Jack came to the station.</p>

<p>It is the twenty-sixth day of
December, the day after Christmas,
and Ruby, having busied herself about the
house most of the morning, in her usual small
way, has gone down to the creek to do Fanny
and Bluebell&#8217;s washing.</p>

<p>There is no reason in the world why those
young ladies&#8217; washing should not be undertaken
in the privacy of the kitchen, save that Jenny,
in an inadvertent moment, has enlightened her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
young mistress as to the primitive Highland
way of doing washing, and has, moreover, shown
her a tiny wood-cut of the same, carefully
preserved in her large-print Bible.</p>

<p>It is no matter to Ruby that the custom is
now almost obsolete. The main thing is that
it is Scottish, and Scottish in every respect Ruby
has quite determined to be.</p>

<p>Fanny and Bluebell sit in upright waxen and
wooden silence against a stone, wrapped each
in a morsel of calico, as most of their garments
are now immersed in water. Bluebell
is a brunette of the wooden-jointed species,
warranted to outlive the hardest usage at the
hands of her young owner. She has lost the
roses from her cheeks, the painted wig from
her head, one leg, and half an arm, in the
struggle for existence; but Bluebell is still good
for a few years more wear. The painted wig
Ruby has restored from one of old Hans&#8217; paint-pots
when he renewed the station outbuildings
last summer; but the complexion and the limbs
are beyond her power. And what is the use
of giving red cheeks to a doll whose face is
liable to be washed at least once a day?</p>

<p>Fanny, the waxen blonde, has fared but little
better. Like Bluebell, she is one-legged, and
possesses a nose from which any pretensions to
wax have long been worn away by too diligent
use of soap and water. Her flaxen head of hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
is her own, and so are her arms, albeit those
latter limbs are devoid of hands. Dolls have
no easier a time of it in the Australian bush
than anywhere else.</p>

<p>It is not amiss, this hot December morning,
to paddle one&#8217;s hands in the cooling water, and
feel that one is busily employed at the same
time. The sun beats down on the large white
hat so diligently bent above the running creek.
Ruby, kneeling on a large boulder, is busily
engaged wringing out Bluebell&#8217;s pink calico dress,
when a new idea comes to her. She will
&#8220;tramp&#8221; the clothes as they are doing in the
picture of the &#8220;Highland washing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such an idea is truly delightful, and Ruby
at once begins to put it into practice by sitting
down and unbuttoning her shoes. But the
hand unfastening the second button pauses,
and the face beneath the large white hat is
uplifted, the brown eyes shining. The sound of
horse&#8217;s hoofs is coming nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s dad!&#8221; Ruby&#8217;s face is aglow now.
&#8220;He&#8217;s come back earlier than he thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>The washing is all forgotten, and flying feet
make for the little side garden-gate, where the
rider is in a leisurely manner dismounting from
his horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dad!&#8221; the little girl cries, then pauses,
for surely this figure is not her father&#8217;s. Ruby
pulls down her hat, the better to see, and looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
up at him. He is giving his horse in charge to
brown-faced Dick, and, raising his hat, comes
towards Ruby.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning,&#8221; he says politely, showing all
his pretty even white teeth in a smile. &#8220;This
is Glengarry, is it not? I am on my way to
the coast, and was directed to Mr. Thorne&#8217;s as
the nearest station.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returns Ruby, half shyly, &#8220;this is
Glengarry. Won&#8217;t you come in and rest.
Mamma is at home, though papa is away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruby knows quite what to do in the circumstances.
Strangers do not come often to Glengarry;
but still they come sometimes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; answers the young man.</p>

<p>He is of middle stature, with rather a tendency
to stoop, and is of a complexion which would
be delicate were it not so sunburnt, with light
brown hair, dark brown eyes, and a smile which
lights up his face like sunlight as he speaks.</p>

<p>Ruby leads him along the verandah, where
the flowering plants twine up the pillars, and
into the room with the shady blue blinds.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a gentleman, mamma,&#8221; Ruby gives
as introduction. &#8220;He is on his way to the
coast.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Ruby has finished her washing, spread
out all the small garments to dry and bleach
upon the grass, and returned to the house, she
finds the stranger still there. The mistress had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
said he was to wait over dinner, so she learns
from Jenny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there you are, Ruby!&#8221; her step-mother
says as the little girl comes into the room.
&#8220;What did you run away for, child? Mr. Kirke
fancies you must have been shy of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Little girls often are,&#8221; says Mr. Kirke, with
that smile which illumines an otherwise plain
face. &#8220;They think I&#8217;m cross.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> don&#8217;t think so!&#8221; decides Ruby, suddenly.
She is gazing up into those other brown eyes
above her, and is fascinated, as most others are,
by Jack Kirke&#8217;s face&mdash;a face stern in repose,
and far from beautiful, but lit up by a smile as
bright as God&#8217;s own sunlight, and as kind.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> don&#8217;t think so?&#8221; repeats the young man,
with another smile for the fair little face uplifted
to his. He puts his arm round the child as he
speaks, and draws her towards him. &#8220;You are
the little girl who thinks such a lot of Scotland,&#8221;
Jack Kirke says.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you know?&#8221; Ruby questions, looking
up with wide brown eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I rather think a little bird must have sung
it to me as I came along,&#8221; the stranger answers
gravely. &#8220;Besides, I&#8217;m Scotch, so of course I
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh-h!&#8221; ejaculates Ruby, her eyes growing
bigger then. &#8220;Tell me about Scotland.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>So, with one arm round Ruby, the big brown
eyes gazing up into the honest ones above her,
and the sunshine, mellowed by the down-drawn
blinds, flooding on the two brown heads, Jack
Kirke tells the little girl all about the unknown
land of Scotland, and his birthplace, the grey
little seaport town of Greenock, on the beautiful
river Clyde.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must come and see me if ever you come
to Scotland, you know, Ruby,&#8221; he tells her.
&#8220;I&#8217;m on my way home now, and shall be jolly
glad to get there; for, after all, there&#8217;s no place
like home, and no place in all the world like
bonnie Scotland.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think that too?&#8221; Ruby cries delightedly.
&#8220;That&#8217;s what mamma always says,
and Jenny. I don&#8217;t remember Scotland,&#8221; Ruby
continues, with a sigh; &#8220;but I dare say, if I
did, I should say it too. And by next Christmas
I shall have seen it. Dad says, &#8216;God
willing;&#8217; but I don&#8217;t see the good of that when
we really are going to go. Do you, Mr.
Kirke?&#8221;</p>

<p>The sunlight is still flooding the room; but
its radiance has died away from Jack Kirke&#8217;s
face, leaving it for the moment cold and stern.
Ruby is half frightened as she looks up at him.
What has chased the brightness from the face
a moment ago so glad?</p>

<p>&#8220;When you are as old as dad and I you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
will be thankful if you can say just that, little
girl,&#8221; he says in a strange, strained voice.</p>

<p>Then Ruby knows that Mr. Kirke is sorry
about something, though she does not know
what, and, child-like, seeks to comfort him in
the grief she does not know. She slips her
small hand into his.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry too,&#8221; she whispers simply.</p>

<p>Again that flash of sunlight illumines the
stern young face. The child&#8217;s words of ready
sympathy have fallen like summer rain into the
heart of the stranger far from home and friends,
and the grief she does not even understand is
somehow lessened by her innocent words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ruby,&#8221; he says suddenly, looking into the
happy little face so near his own, &#8220;I want you
to do something for me. I want you to call me
Jack. Nobody has called me that since I left
home, and it would make it feel like old times
to hear you say it. Don&#8217;t be afraid because I&#8217;m
too old. It isn&#8217;t so very long ago since I was
young like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; whispers Ruby, almost shyly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good little girl!&#8221; Jack Kirke says approvingly.
A very beautiful light is shining in his
brown eyes, and he stoops suddenly and kisses
the wondering child. &#8220;I must send you out a
Christmas present for that,&#8221; Jack adds. &#8220;What
is it to be, Ruby? A new doll?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must excuse me, Mr. Kirke,&#8221; the lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
of the house observes apologetically as she comes
back to the room. She has actually taken the
trouble to cross the quadrangle to assist Jenny
in sundry small matters connected with the
midday meal. &#8220;I am sorry I had to leave you
for a little,&#8221; Mrs. Thorne goes on. &#8220;I hope
Ruby has been entertaining you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ruby is a hostess in herself,&#8221; Jack Kirke
returns, laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and mamma!&#8221; cries Ruby. &#8220;I&#8217;m to
go to see him in Scotland. Jack says so, in
Green&mdash;Green&mdash;&mdash;I can&#8217;t remember the name
of the place; but it&#8217;s where they build ships,
beside the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ruby!&#8221; her step-mother remonstrates, horror-stricken.
&#8220;Who&#8217;s Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Him!&#8221; cries Ruby, triumphantly, a fat forefinger
denoting her new-found friend. &#8220;He said
I was to call him Jack,&#8221; explains the little girl.
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you, Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I did,&#8221; that young man says good-naturedly.
&#8220;And promised to send you a doll
for doing it, the very best that Greenock or
Glasgow can supply.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is evident that the pair have vowed eternal
friendship&mdash;a friendship which only grows as
the afternoon goes on.</p>

<p>When Mr. Thorne comes home he insists
that the young Scotchman shall stay the
night, which Jack Kirke is nothing loth to do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Ruby even does him the honour of introducing
him to both her dolls and to her bleaching
green, and presents him with supreme dignity
to Jenny as &#8220;Mr. Kirke, a gentleman from
Scotland.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish next Christmas wasn&#8217;t so far away,
Jack,&#8221; Ruby says that evening as they sit on
the verandah. &#8220;It&#8217;s such a long time till ever
we see you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet you never saw me before this
morning,&#8221; says the young man, laughing. He
is both pleased and flattered by the affection
which the little lady has seen fit to shower upon
him. &#8220;And I dare say that by this time to-morrow
you will have forgotten that there is
such a person in existence,&#8221; Jack adds teasingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t ever forget you,&#8221; Ruby protests
loyally. &#8220;Will we, mamma? He&#8217;s just the
nicest &#8216;stranger&#8217; that ever came to Glengarry
since we came.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a decided compliment for you, Mr.
Kirke,&#8221; laughs Ruby&#8217;s father. &#8220;I&#8217;m getting
quite jealous of your attentions, little woman.
It is well you are not a little older, or Mr.
Kirke might find them very much too marked.&#8221;</p>

<p>The white moonlight is flooding the land
when at length they retire to rest. Ruby&#8217;s dreams
are all of her new-found friend whom she is
so soon to lose, and when she is awakened by
the sunlight of the newer morning streaming in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
upon her face a rush of gladness and of sorrow
strive hard for mastery in her heart&mdash;gladness
because Jack is still here, sorrow because he is
going away.</p>

<p>Her father is to ride so far with the traveller
upon his way, and Ruby stands with dim eyes
at the garden-gate watching them start.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, little Ruby red,&#8221; Jack Kirke says
as he stoops to kiss her. &#8220;Remember next
Christmas, and remember the new dolly I&#8217;m to
send you when I get home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Jack,&#8221; Ruby whispers in a choked
voice. &#8220;I&#8217;ll always remember you; and, Jack, if
there&#8217;s any other little girl in Scotland you&#8217;ll
perhaps like better than me, I&#8217;ll try not to mind
<i>very</i> much.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack Kirke twirls his moustache and smiles.
There <i>is</i> another little girl in the question, a
little girl whom he has known all her life, and
who is all the world to her loyal-hearted lover.
The only question now at issue is as to whether
Jack Kirke is all the world to the woman
whom, he has long since decided, like Geraint
of old, is the &#8220;one maid&#8221; for him.</p>

<p>Then the two riders pass out into the sunshine,
Jack Kirke with a last look back and
a wave of the hand for the desolate little blue
figure left standing at the gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Till next Christmas, Ruby!&#8221; his voice rings
out cheerily, and then they are gone, through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
blaze of sunlight which shines none the dimmer
because Ruby sees it through a mist of tears.</p>

<p>It is her first remembered tasting of that most
sorrowful of all words, &#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; a good-bye
none the less bitter that the &#8220;good morning&#8221;
came to her but in yesterday&#8217;s sunshine. It is
not always those whom we have known the
longest whom we love the best.</p>

<p>Even the thought of the promised new doll
fails to comfort the little girl in this her first
keenest sorrow of parting. For long she stands
at the gate, gazing out into the sunlight, which
beats down hotly upon her uncovered head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only till next Christmas anyway,&#8221; Ruby
murmurs with a shadowy attempt at a smile.
&#8220;And it won&#8217;t be so <i>very</i> long to pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rubs her eyes with her hand as she
speaks, and is almost surprised, when she draws
it away, to find a tear there.</p>

<small>THE CHRISTMAS CARD.</small></h2></div>



<p class="center">&#8220;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will
toward men.&#8221;</p>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i028dc.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;MAY?&#8221; Ruby says. &#8220;I wonder who
that can be?&#8221;</p>

<p>She turns the card with its illuminated
wreath of holly and conventional
glistening snow scene this way and
that. &#8220;It&#8217;s very pretty,&#8221; the little girl murmurs
admiringly. &#8220;But who can &#8216;May&#8217; be?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Christmas card under inspection has
been discovered by Jenny upon the floor of the
room where Mr. Jack Kirke has spent the night,
dropped there probably in the hurried start of
the morning. It has evidently been a very
precious thing in its owner&#8217;s eyes, this card; for
it is wrapped in a little piece of white tissue
paper and enclosed in an unsealed envelope.
Jenny has forthwith delivered this treasure over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
to Ruby, who, seated upon the edge of the
verandah, is now busily scrutinizing it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack, from May,&#8221; is written upon the back
of the card in a large girlish scrawl. That is
all; there is no date, no love or good wishes
sent, only those three words: &#8220;Jack, from
May;&#8221; and in front of the card, beneath the
glittering snow scene and intermingling with
the scarlet wreath, the Christmas benediction:
&#8220;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
peace, good will toward men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s May, I wonder,&#8221; Ruby murmurs
again, almost jealously. &#8220;P&#8217;raps another little
girl in Scotland he never told me about. I
wonder why he didn&#8217;t speak about her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruby does not know that the &#8220;May&#8221; of the
carefully cherished card is a little girl of
whom Jack but rarely speaks, though she lives
in his thoughts day and night. Far away in
Scotland a blue-eyed maiden&#8217;s heart is going out
in longing to the man who only by his absence
had proved to the friend of his childhood how
much she loved him. Her heart is in sunny
Australia, and his in bonnie Scotland, all for
love each of the other.</p>

<p>Having failed, even with the best intentions
to discover who May is, Ruby turns her attention
to the picture and the text.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Glory to God in the highest,&#8217;&#8221; the little girl
reads&mdash;&#8220;that&#8217;s out of the Bible&mdash;&#8216;and on earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
peace, good will toward men.&#8217; I wonder what
&#8216;good will&#8217; means? I s&#8217;pose p&#8217;raps it just means
to be kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>All around the child is the monotonous silence
of the Australian noon, unbroken save by the
faint silvery wash of the creek over the stones
on its way to the river, and the far-away sound
of old Hans&#8217; axe as he &#8220;rings&#8221; the trees. To be
&#8220;kind,&#8221; that is what the Christmas text means
in Ruby&#8217;s mind, but there is no one here to
be &#8220;kind&#8221; to.</p>

<p>&#8220;And of course that card would be made in
Scotland, where there are lots of people to be
kind to,&#8221; the little girl decides thoughtfully.</p>

<p>She is gazing out far away over the path
which leads to the coast. Beyond that lies the
sea, and beyond the sea Scotland. What would
not Ruby give to be in bonnie Scotland just
now!</p>

<p>The child rises and goes through the house
and across the courtyard to the stables. The
stables are situated on the fourth side of the
quadrangle; but at present are but little used,
as most of the horses are grazing at their own
sweet will in the adjoining paddock just now.</p>

<p>Dick comes out of the coach-house pulling
his forelock. This building is desolate save for
a very dilapidated conveyance termed &#8220;buggy&#8221;
in Australia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wantin&#8217; to go for a ride, Miss Ruby?&#8221; Dick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
asks. Dick is Ruby&#8217;s cavalier upon those
occasions when she desires to ride abroad.
&#8220;Smuttie&#8217;s out in the paddock. I&#8217;ll catch him
for you if you like,&#8221; he adds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring him round to the gate,&#8221; his young
mistress says. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have got on my things by
the time you&#8217;ve got him ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>Smuttie is harnessed and ready by the time
Ruby reappears. He justifies his name, being
a coal-black pony, rather given over to obesity,
but a good little fellow for all that. Dick has
hitched his own pony to the garden-gate, and now
stands holding Smuttie&#8217;s bridle, and awaiting
his little mistress&#8217;s will.</p>

<p>The sun streams brightly down upon them
as they start, Ruby riding slowly ahead. In
such weather Smuttie prefers to take life easily.
It is with reluctant feet that he has left the
paddock at all; but now that he has, so to
speak, been driven out of Eden, he is resolved
in his pony heart that he will not budge one
hair&#8217;s-breadth quicker than necessity requires.</p>

<p>Dick has fastened a handkerchief beneath his
broad-brimmed hat, and his young mistress is
not slow to follow his example and do the
same.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hot enough to start a fire without a light,&#8221;
Dick remarks from behind as they jog along.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw one,&#8221; Ruby returns almost
humbly. She knows that Dick refers to a bush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
fire, and that for a dweller in the bush she
ought long before this to have witnessed such
a spectacle. &#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s very frightsome,&#8221;
Ruby adds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Frightsome! I should just think so!&#8221; Dick
ejaculates. He laughs to himself at the question.
&#8220;Saw one the last place I was in,&#8221; the
boy goes on. &#8220;My! it was grand, and no mistake.
Your pa&#8217;s never had one here, Miss Ruby;
but it&#8217;s not every one that&#8217;s as lucky. It&#8217;s just
like&#8221;&mdash;Dick pauses for a simile&mdash;&#8220;like a steam-engine
rushing along, for all the world, the fire
is. Then you can see it for miles and miles
away, and it&#8217;s all you can do to keep up with it
and try to burn on ahead to keep it out. If
you&#8217;d seen one, Miss Ruby, you&#8217;d never like to
see another.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rounding a thicket, they come upon old Hans,
the German, busy in his employment of &#8220;ringing&#8221;
the trees. This ringing is the Australian
method of thinning a forest, and consists in
notching a ring or circle about the trunks of
the trees, thus impeding the flow of sap to the
branches, and causing in time their death. The
trees thus &#8220;ringed&#8221; form indeed a melancholy
spectacle, their long arms stretched bare and
appealingly up to heaven, as if craving for the
blessing of growth now for ever denied them.</p>

<p>The old German raises his battered hat respectfully
to the little mistress.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>&#8220;Hot day, missie,&#8221; he mutters as salutation.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be dreadfully hot,&#8221; Ruby says
compassionately.</p>

<p>The old man&#8217;s face is hot enough in all
conscience. He raises his broad-brimmed hat
again, and wipes the perspiration from his damp
forehead with a large blue-cotton handkerchief.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s desp&#8217;rate hot,&#8221; Dick puts in as his item
to the conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to take a rest, Hans,&#8221; the little
girl suggests with ready commiseration. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sure dad wouldn&#8217;t mind. He doesn&#8217;t like me to
do things when it&#8217;s so hot, and he wouldn&#8217;t like
you either. Your face is just ever so red, as
red as the fire, and you look dreadful tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ach! and I <i>am</i> tired,&#8221; the old man ejaculates,
with a broad smile. &#8220;But what of that?
But a little more work, a little more tiring out,
and the dear Lord will send for old Hans to be
with Him for ever in that best and brightest
land of all. Is it not so, missie? The work
has not come to those little hands of thine yet,
but the day may come when thou too wilt be
glad to leave the toil behind thee, and be
at rest. Ach! but what am I saying?&#8221; The
smile broadens on the tired old face. &#8220;Why
do I talk of death to thee, <i>liebchen</i>, whose life
is all play? The sunlight is made for such as
thee, on whom the shadows have not even
begun to fall.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>Ruby gives just the tiniest suspicion of a sob
stifled in a sniff.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not to talk like that, Hans,&#8221; she remonstrates
in rather an injured manner. &#8220;We
don&#8217;t want you to die&mdash;do we, Dick?&#8221; she
appeals to her faithful servitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;No more&#8217;n we don&#8217;t,&#8221; Dick agrees.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you see,&#8221; Ruby goes on with the air of
a small queen, &#8220;you&#8217;re not to say things like
that ever again. And I&#8217;ll tell dad you&#8217;re not
to work so hard; dad always does what I want
him to do&mdash;usually.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man looks after the two retreating
figures as they ride away.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a dear little lady, she is,&#8221; he mutters
to himself. &#8220;But she can&#8217;t be expected to
understand, God bless her! how the longing
comes for the home-land when one is weary.
Good Lord, let it not be long.&#8221; The old
man&#8217;s tired eyes are uplifted to the wide expanse
of blue, beyond which, to his longing
vision, lies the home-land for which he yearns.
Then, wiping his axe upon his shirt-sleeve, old
Hans begins his &#8220;ringing&#8221; again.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a queer old boy,&#8221; Dick remarks as
they ride through the sunshine. Though a
servant, and obliged to ride behind, Dick sees
no reason why he should be excluded from conversation.
Nor does Ruby. She would have
found those rides over the rough bush roads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
very dull work had there been no Dick to
talk to.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a nice old man!&#8221; Ruby exclaims
staunchly. &#8220;He&#8217;s just tired, or he wouldn&#8217;t
have said that,&#8221; she goes on. She has an idea
that Dick is rather inclined to laugh at German
Hans.</p>

<p>They are riding along now by the river&#8217;s
bank, where the white clouds floating across
the azure sky, and the tall grasses by the
margin are reflected in its cool depths. About
a mile or so farther on, at the turn of the river,
a ruined mill stands, while, far as eye can reach
on every hand, stretch unending miles of bush.
Dick&#8217;s eyes have been fixed on the mill; but
now they wander to Ruby.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better turn &#8217;fore we get there, Miss
Ruby,&#8221; he recommends, indicating the tumbledown
building with the willowy switch he has
been whittling as they come along. &#8220;That&#8217;s
the place your pa don&#8217;t like you for to pass&mdash;old
Davis, you know. Your pa&#8217;s been down
on him lately for stealing sheep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure dad won&#8217;t mind,&#8221; cries Ruby,
with a little toss of the head. &#8220;And I want
to go,&#8221; she adds, looking round at Dick, her
bright face flushed with exercise, and her brown
hair flying behind her like a veritable little
Amazon.</p>

<p>That settles the question. Dick knows by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
sore experience that when this little lady wants
her own way she usually gets it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your pa said,&#8221; he mutters; but it is all of
no avail, and they continue their course by the
river bank.</p>

<p>The cottage stands with its back to the river,
the mill, now idle and unused, is built alongside.
Once on a day this same mill was a busy
enough place, now it is falling to decay for lack
of use, and no sign or sound either there or at
the cottage testify to the whereabouts of the
lonely inhabitant. An enormous brindled cat is
mewing upon the doorstep, a couple of gaunt
hens and a bedraggled cock are pacing the
deserted gardens, while from a lean-to outhouse
comes the unmistakable grunt of a pig.
Dick heaves a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not at home,&#8221; he mutters. &#8220;I&#8217;m just
as glad, for your pa would have been mighty
angry with me. Somewhere not far off he&#8217;ll
be, I reckon, and up to no good. Come along,
Miss Ruby; we&#8217;d better be getting home, or
the mistress&#8217;ll be wondering what&#8217;s come over
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>They are riding homewards by the river&#8217;s
bank, when they come upon a curious figure.
An old, old man, bent almost double under his
load of faggots, his red handkerchief tied three
cornered-wise beneath his chin to protect his
ancient head from the blazing sun. The face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
which looks out at them from beneath this strange
head-gear is yellow and wizened, and the once
keen blue eyes are dim and bleared, yet withal
there is a sort of low cunning about the whole
countenance which sends a sudden shiver to
Ruby&#8217;s heart, and prompts Dick to touch up
both ponies with that convenient switch of his
so smartly as to cause even lethargic Smuttie
to break into a canter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221; Ruby asks in a half-frightened
whisper as they slacken pace again. She looks
over her shoulder as she asks the question.</p>

<p>The old man is standing just as they left him,
gazing after them through a flood of golden
light. Dick looks too.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s an old wicked one!&#8221; he mutters.
&#8220;That&#8217;s him, Miss Ruby, him as we were
speaking about, old Davis, as stole your pa&#8217;s
sheep. Your pa would have had him put in
prison, but that he was such an old one. He&#8217;s
a bad lot though, so he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got a horrid face. I don&#8217;t like his face
one bit,&#8221; says Ruby. Her own face is very
white as she speaks, and her brown eyes ablaze.
&#8220;I wish we hadn&#8217;t seen him,&#8221; shivers the little
girl, as they set their faces homewards.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THAT night Ruby has a curious dream.
It is stilly night, and she is standing
down by the creek, watching
the dance and play of the water
over the stones on its way to the river. All
around her the moonlight is streaming, kissing
the limpid water into silver, and in the deep
blue of the sky the stars are twinkling like
gems on the robe of the great King.</p>

<p>Not a sound can the little girl hear save the
gentle murmur of the stream over the stones.
All the world&mdash;the white, white, moon-radiant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
world&mdash;seems to be sleeping save Ruby; she
alone is awake.</p>

<p>Stranger than all, though she is all alone,
the child feels no sense of dread. She is
content to stand there, watching the moon-kissed
stream rushing by, her only companions
those ever-watchful lights of heaven, the stars.</p>

<p>Faint music is sounding in her ears, music
so faint and far away that it almost seems to
come from the streets of the Golden City, where
the redeemed sing the &#8220;new song&#8221; of the Lamb
through an endless day. Ruby strains her ears
to catch the notes echoing through the still
night in faint far-off cadence.</p>

<p>Nearer, ever nearer, it comes; clearer, ever
clearer, ring those glad strains of joy, till, with
a great, glorious rush they seem to flood the
whole world:</p>

<p>&#8220;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
peace; good will toward men!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s on Jack&#8217;s card!&#8221; Ruby cannot help exclaiming;
but the words die away upon her lips.</p>

<p>Gazing upwards, she sees such a blaze of glory
as almost seems to blind her. Strangely enough
the thought that this is only a dream, and the
attendant necessity of pinching, do not occur
to Ruby just now.</p>

<p>She is gazing upwards in awestruck wonder
to the shining sky. What is this vision of fair
faces, angel faces, hovering above her, faces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
shining with a light which &#8220;never was on land
or sea,&#8221; the radiance from their snowy wings
striking athwart the gloom?</p>

<p>And in great, glorious unison the grand old
Christmas carol rings forth&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
peace; good will toward men!&#8221;</p>

<p>Open-eyed and awestruck, the little girl
stands gazing upwards, a wonder fraught with
strange beauty at her heart. Can it be possible
that one of those bright-faced angels may be
the mother whom Ruby never knew, sent from
the far-off land to bear the Christmas message
to the child who never missed a mother&#8217;s love
because she never knew it?</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mamma,&#8221; cries poor Ruby, stretching
appealing hands up to the shining throng, &#8220;take
me with you! Take me with you back to
heaven!&#8221;</p>

<p>She hardly knows why the words rise to her
lips. Heaven has never been a very real place
to this little girl, although her mother is there;
the far-off city, with its pearly gates and golden
streets, holds but a shadowy place in Ruby&#8217;s
heart, and before to-night she has never greatly
desired to enter therein.</p>

<p>The life of the present has claimed all her
attention, and, amidst the joys and pleasures
of to-day, the coming life has held but little
place. But now, with heaven&#8217;s glories almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
opened before her, with the &#8220;new song&#8221; of the
blessed in her ears, with her own long-lost
mother so near, Ruby would fain be gone.</p>

<p>Slowly the glory fades away, the angel faces
grow dimmer and dimmer, the heavenly music
dies into silence, and the world is calm and
hushed as before. Still Ruby stands gazing
upwards, longing for the angel visitants to come
again. But no heavenly light illumines the sky,
only the pale radiance of the moon, and no
sound breaks upon the child&#8217;s listening ear
save the monotonous music of the ever-flowing
water.</p>

<p>With a disappointed little sigh, Ruby brings
her gaze back to earth again. The white moonlight
is flooding the country for miles around,
and in its light the ringed trees in the cleared
space about the station stand up gaunt and tall
like watchful sentinels over this home in the
lonely bush. Yet Ruby has no desire to retrace
her steps homewards. It may be that the angel
host with their wondrous song will come again.
So the child lingers, throwing little pebbles in
the brook, and watching the miniature circles
widen and widen, brightened to limpid silver in
the sheeny light.</p>

<p>A halting footstep makes her turn her head.
There, a few paces away, a bent figure is coming
wearifully along, weighted down beneath its
bundle of faggots. Near Ruby it stumbles and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
falls, the faggots rolling from the wearied back
down to the creek, where, caught by a boulder, they
swing this way and that in the flowing water.</p>

<p>Involuntarily the child gives a step forward,
then springs back with a sudden shiver. &#8220;It&#8217;s
the wicked old one,&#8221; she whispers. &#8220;And I
<i>couldn&#8217;t</i> help him! Oh, I <i>couldn&#8217;t</i> help him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On earth peace, good will toward men!&#8221;
Faint and far away is the echo, yet full of
meaning to the child&#8217;s heart. She gives a backward
glance over her shoulder at the fallen old
man. He is groping with his hands this way and
that, as though in darkness, and the blood is
flowing from a cut in the ugly yellow wizened face.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it wasn&#8217;t <i>him</i>,&#8221; Ruby mutters. &#8220;If it
was anybody else but the wicked old one; but
I can&#8217;t be kind to <i>him</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On earth peace, good will toward men!&#8221;
Clearer and clearer rings out the angel benison,
sent from the gates of heaven, where Ruby&#8217;s
mother waits to welcome home again the husband
and child from whose loving arms she
was so soon called away. To be &#8220;kind,&#8221; that
is what Ruby has decided &#8220;good will&#8221; means.
Is she, then, being kind, to the old man whose
groping hands appeal so vainly to her aid?</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad wouldn&#8217;t like me to,&#8221; decides Ruby,
trying to stifle the voice of conscience. &#8220;And
he&#8217;s <i>such</i> a horrid old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clearer and still clearer, higher and still higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
rings out the angels&#8217; singing. There is a queer
sort of tugging going on at Ruby&#8217;s heart. She
knows she ought to go back to help old Davis
and yet she cannot&mdash;cannot!</p>

<p>Then a great flash of light comes before her
eyes, and Ruby suddenly wakens to find herself
in her own little bed, the white curtains drawn
closely to ward off mosquitoes, and the morning
sun slanting in and forming a long golden bar
on the opposite curtain.</p>

<p>The little girl rubs her eyes and stares about
her. She, who has so often even doubted
reality, finds it hard to believe that what has
passed is really a dream. Even yet the angel
voices seem to be sounding in her ears, the
heavenly light dazzling her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;And they weren&#8217;t angels, after all,&#8221; murmurs
Ruby in a disappointed voice. &#8220;It was only a
dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>Only a dream! How many of our so-called
realities are &#8220;only a dream,&#8221; from which we
waken with disappointed hearts and saddened
eyes. One far day there will come to us that
which is not a dream, but a reality, which can
never pass away, and we shall awaken in
heaven&#8217;s morning, being &#8220;satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad,&#8221; asks Ruby as they go about the
station that morning, she hanging on her father&#8217;s
arm, &#8220;what was my mamma like&mdash;my own
mamma, I mean?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>The big man smiles, and looks down into the
eager little face uplifted to his own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your own mamma, little woman,&#8221; he repeats
gently. &#8220;Poor little girl! of course you don&#8217;t
remember her. You remind me of her, Ruby,
in a great many ways, and it is my greatest
wish that you grow up just such a woman as
your dear mother was. Why are you asking,
little girlie? I don&#8217;t think you ever asked me
about your mother before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I just wondered,&#8221; says Ruby. She is
gazing up into the cloudless blue of the sky,
which has figured so vividly in her dream of
last night. &#8220;I wish I remembered her,&#8221; Ruby
murmurs, with the tiniest sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor little lassie!&#8221; says the father, patting
the small hand. &#8220;Her greatest sorrow was in
leaving you, Ruby. You were just a baby
when she died. Not long before she went
away she spoke about you, her little girl whom
she was so unwilling to leave. &#8216;Tell my little
Ruby,&#8217; she said, &#8216;that I shall be waiting for
her. I have prayed to the dear Lord Jesus
that she may be one of those whom He gathers
that day when He comes to make up His
jewels.&#8217; She used to call you her little jewel,
Ruby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And my name means a jewel,&#8221; says Ruby,
looking up into her father&#8217;s face with big,
wondering brown eyes. The dream mother has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
come nearer to her little girl during those last
few minutes than she has ever done before.
Those words, spoken so long ago, have made
Ruby feel her long-dead young mother to be
a real personality, albeit separated from the
little girl for whom one far day she had prayed
that Christ might number her among His jewels.
In that fair city, &#8220;into which no foe can enter,
and from which no friend can ever pass away,&#8221;
Ruby&#8217;s mother has done with all care and sorrow.
God Himself has wiped away all tears from
her eyes for ever.</p>

<p>Ruby goes about with a very sober little face
that morning. She gathers fresh flowers for
the sitting-room, and carries the flower-glasses
across the courtyard to the kitchen to wash
them out. This is one of Ruby&#8217;s customary
little duties. She has a variety of such small
tasks which fill up the early hours of the morning.
After this Ruby usually conscientiously
learns a few lessons, which her step-mother
hears her recite now and then, as the humour
seizes her.</p>

<p>But at present Ruby is enjoying holidays in
honour of Christmas, holidays which the little
girl has decided shall last a month or more, if
she can possibly manage it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re very quiet to-day, Ruby,&#8221; observes her
step-mother, as the child goes about the room,
placing the vases of flowers in their accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
places. Mrs. Thorne is reclining upon her
favourite sofa, the latest new book which the
station affords in her hand. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you well,
child?&#8221; she asks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I quiet?&#8221; Ruby says. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t notice,
mamma. I&#8217;m all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is true, as the little girl has said, that she
has not even noticed that she is more quiet
than usual. Involuntarily her thoughts have
gone out to the mother whom she never
knew, the mother who even now is waiting in
sunny Paradise for the little daughter she has
left behind. Since she left her so long ago, Ruby
has hardly given a thought to her mother. The
snow is lying thick on her grave in the little
Scottish kirkyard at home; but Ruby has been
happy enough without her, living her own glad
young life without fear of death, and with no
thought to spare for the heaven beyond.</p>

<p>But now the radiant vision of last night&#8217;s
dream, combined with her father&#8217;s words, have
set the child thinking. Will the Lord Jesus
indeed answer her mother&#8217;s prayer, and one
day gather little Ruby among His jewels?
Will he care very much that this little jewel of
His has never tried very hard throughout her
short life to work His will or do His bidding?
What if, when the Lord Jesus comes, He finds
Ruby all unworthy to be numbered amongst
those jewels of His? And the long-lost mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
who even in heaven will be the gladder that
her little daughter is with her there, how will
she bear to know that the prayer she prayed so
long ago is all in vain?</p>

<p>&#8220;And if he doesn&#8217;t gather me,&#8221; Ruby
murmurs, staring straight up into the clear,
blue sky, &#8220;what shall I do? Oh, what shall
I do?&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">JACK&#8217;S card is placed upright on the
mantel-piece of Ruby&#8217;s bedroom,
its back leaning against the wall,
and before it stands a little girl
with a troubled face, and a perplexed wrinkle
between her brows.</p>

<p>&#8220;It says it there,&#8221; Ruby murmurs, the perplexed
wrinkle deepening. &#8220;And that text&#8217;s
out of the Bible. But when there&#8217;s nobody to
be kind to, I can&#8217;t do anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sun is glinting on the frosted snow scene;
but Ruby is not looking at the snow scene.
Her eyes are following the old, old words of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the first Christmas carol: &#8220;Glory to God in the
highest, and on earth peace, good will toward
men!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If there was only anybody to be kind
to,&#8221; the little girl repeats slowly. &#8220;Dad and
mamma don&#8217;t need me to be kind to them,
and I <i>am</i> quite kind to Hans and Dick. If it
was only in Scotland now; but it&#8217;s quite different
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The soft summer wind is swaying the window-blinds
gently to and fro, and ruffling with its
soft breath the thirsty, parched grass about
the station. To the child&#8217;s mind has come a
remembrance, a remembrance of what was
&#8220;only a dream,&#8221; and she sees an old, old man,
bowed down with the weight of years, coming
to her across the moonlit paths of last night,
an old man whom Ruby had let lie where
he fell, because he was only &#8220;the wicked old
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was only a dream, so it didn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;
Thus the little girl tries to soothe a suddenly
awakened conscience. &#8220;And he <i>is</i> a wicked old
one; Dick said he was.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruby goes over to the window, and stands
looking out. There is no change in the fair
Australian scene; on just such a picture Ruby&#8217;s
eyes have rested since first she came. But
there is a strange, unexplained change in the
little girl&#8217;s heart. Only that the dear Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Jesus has come to Ruby, asking her for His
dear sake to be kind to one of the lowest and
humblest of His creatures.</p>

<p>The child gives an impatient wriggle. &#8220;If it
was only anybody else,&#8221; she mutters. &#8220;But he&#8217;s
so horrid, and he has such a horrid face. And
I don&#8217;t see what I could do to be kind to such
a nasty old man as he is. Besides, perhaps
dad wouldn&#8217;t like me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good will toward men! Good will toward
men!&#8221; Again the heavenly voices seem ringing
in Ruby&#8217;s ears. There is no angel host
about her to strengthen and encourage her,
only one very lonely little girl who finds it hard
to do right when the doing of that right does
not quite fit in with her own inclinations. She
has taken the first step upon the heavenly
way, and finds already the shadow of the
cross.</p>

<p>The radiance of the sunshine is reflected in
Ruby&#8217;s brown eyes, the radiance, it may be, of
something far greater in her heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221; the little girl decides suddenly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to be kind to the &#8216;old one.&#8217; Only
what can I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Ruby!&#8221; cries an excited voice at
the window, and, looking out, Ruby sees Dick&#8217;s
brown face and merry eyes. &#8220;Come &#8217;long as
quick as you can. There&#8217;s a fire, and you said
t&#8217;other day you&#8217;d never seen one. I&#8217;ll get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Smuttie if you come as quick as you can. It&#8217;s
over by old Davis&#8217;s place.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dick&#8217;s young mistress does not need a second
bidding. She is out waiting by the garden-gate
long before Smuttie is caught and harnessed.
Away to the west she can see the long glare of
fire shooting up tongues of flame into the still
sunlight, and brightening the river into a very
sea of blood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you should go, Ruby,&#8221; says
her mother, who has come out on the verandah.
&#8220;It isn&#8217;t safe, and you are so venturesome. I
am dreadfully anxious about your father too.
Dick says he and the men are off to help putting
out the fire; but in such weather as this I
don&#8217;t see how they can ever possibly get it
extinguished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be very, very careful, mamma,&#8221; Ruby
promises. Her brown eyes are ablaze with excitement,
and her cheeks aglow. &#8220;And I&#8217;ll be
there to watch dad too, you know,&#8221; she adds
persuasively in a voice which expresses the belief
that not much danger can possibly come to dad
while his little girl is near.</p>

<p>Dick has brought Smuttie round to the
garden-gate, and in a moment he and his little
mistress are off, cantering as fast as Smuttie can
be got to go, to the scene of the fire.</p>

<p>Those who have witnessed a fire in the bush
will never forget it. The first spark, induced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
sometimes by a fallen match, ignited often by
the excessive heat of the sun&#8217;s rays, gains ground
with appalling rapidity, and where the growth is
dry, large tracts of ground have often been laid
waste. In excessively hot weather this is more
particularly the case, and it is then found almost
impossible to extinguish the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at it!&#8221; Dick cries excitedly. &#8220;Goin&#8217;
like a steam-engine just. Wish we hadn&#8217;t
brought Smuttie, Miss Ruby. He&#8217;ll maybe be
frightened at the fire. My! they&#8217;ve got the
start of it. Do you see that other fire on
ahead? That&#8217;s where they&#8217;re burning down!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruby looks. Yes, there <i>are</i> two fires, both,
it seems, running, as Dick has said, &#8220;like steam-engines.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My!&#8221; the boy cries suddenly; &#8220;it&#8217;s the old
wicked one&#8217;s house. It&#8217;s it that has got afire.
My! they&#8217;ll never get that out. There&#8217;s not
enough of them to do that, and to stop the fire
too. And it&#8217;ll be on to your pa&#8217;s land if they
don&#8217;t stop it pretty soon. I&#8217;ll have to help them,
Miss Ruby. And what&#8217;ll you do? You&#8217;ll have
to get off Smuttie and hold him in case he gets
scared at the fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Dick!&#8221; the little girl cries. Her face is
very pale, and her eyes are fixed on that lurid
light, ever growing nearer. &#8220;Do you think he&#8217;ll
be dead? Do you think the old man&#8217;ll be
dead?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>&#8220;Not him,&#8221; Dick returns, with a grin. &#8220;He&#8217;s
too bad to die, he is. Those wicked old ones
always live the longest. Nothing ever harms
them. My! but I wish he was dead!&#8221; the boy
ejaculates. &#8220;It would be a good riddance of
bad rubbish, that&#8217;s what it would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Dick,&#8221; shivers Ruby, &#8220;I wish you
wouldn&#8217;t say that. What if he was to be dead!
And I&#8217;ve never been kind! I&#8217;ve never been
kind!&#8221; Ruby breaks out in a wail, which Dick
does not understand.</p>

<p>They are nearing the scene of the fire now.
Luckily the cottage is hard by the river, so
there is no scarcity of water. But the willing
workers are but few. Stations are scarce and
far between in the Australian bush, and the
inhabitants not easily got together. There are
two detachments of men at work, one party
endeavouring to extinguish the flames of poor
old Davis&#8217;s burning cottage, the others far in
the distance trying to stop the progress of the
fire by burning down the thickets in advance,
and thus starving the main fire as it gains
ground. This method of &#8220;starving the fire&#8221; is
well known to dwellers in the Australian bush,
though at times the second fire thus given birth
to assumes such proportions as to outrun its
predecessor.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not much use. It&#8217;s too dry,&#8221; Dick
mutters. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like leaving you, Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Ruby; but I&#8217;ll have to do it. Even a boy&#8217;s a
bit of help in bringing the water. You don&#8217;t
mind, do you, Miss Ruby? I think, if I was
you, now that you&#8217;ve seen it, I&#8217;d turn and go
home again. Smuttie&#8217;s easy enough managed;
but if he got frightened, I don&#8217;t know what
you&#8217;d do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get down and hold him,&#8221; Ruby says. &#8220;I
want to watch.&#8221; Her heart is sick within her.
She has never seen a fire before, and it seems
so fraught with danger that she trembles when
she thinks of dad, the being she loves best on
earth. &#8220;Go you away to the fire, Dick,&#8221; adds
Ruby, very pale, but very determined. &#8220;I&#8217;m
not afraid of being left alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fire is gaining ground every moment, and
poor old Davis&#8217;s desolate home bids fair to be
soon nothing but a heap of blackened ruins.
Dick gives one look at the burning house, and
another at his little mistress. There is no time
to waste if he is to be of any use.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like leaving you, Miss Ruby,&#8221; says
Dick again; but he goes all the same.</p>

<p>Ruby, left alone, stands by Smuttie&#8217;s head,
consoling that faithful little animal now and
then with a pat of the hand. It is hot, scorchingly
hot; but such cold dread sits at the little
girl&#8217;s heart that she does not even feel the heat.
In her ears is the hissing of those fierce flames,
and her love for dad has grown to be a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
agony in the thought that something may
befall him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ruby!&#8221; says a well-known voice, and through
the blaze of sunlight she sees her father coming
towards her. His face, like Ruby&#8217;s, is very pale,
and his hands are blackened with the grime and
soot. &#8220;You ought not to be here, child. It
isn&#8217;t even safe. Away home to your mother,
and tell her it is all right, for I know she will
be feeling anxious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But is it all right, dad?&#8221; the little girl
questions anxiously. Her eyes flit from dad&#8217;s
face to the burning cottage, and then to those
other figures in the lurid light far away. &#8220;And
mamma <i>will</i> be frightened; for she&#8217;ll think
you&#8217;ll be getting hurt. And so will I,&#8221; adds
poor Ruby with a little catch in her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;What nonsense, little girl,&#8221; says her father
cheerfully. &#8220;There, dear, I have no time to
wait, so get on Smuttie, and let me see you
away. That&#8217;s a brave little girl,&#8221; he adds,
stooping to kiss the small anxious face.</p>

<p>It is with a sore, sore heart that Ruby rides
home lonely by the river&#8217;s side. She has not
waited for her trouble to come to her, but has
met it half way, as more people than little
brown-eyed Ruby are too fond of doing. Dad
is the very dearest thing Ruby has in the whole
wide world, and if anything happens to dad,
whatever will she do?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>&#8220;I just couldn&#8217;t bear it,&#8221; murmurs poor Ruby,
wiping away a very big tear which has fallen
on Smuttie&#8217;s broad back.</p>

<p>Ah, little girl with the big, tearful, brown
eyes, you have still to learn that any trouble
can be borne patiently, and with a brave face
to the world, if only God gives His help!</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THAT is a long, long day to Ruby.
From Glengarry they can watch far
away the flames, like so many forked
and lurid tongues of fire, leaping up
into the still air and looking strangely out of
place against the hazy blue of the summer sky.
The little girl leaves her almost untouched
dinner, and steals out to the verandah, where
she sits, a forlorn-looking little figure, in the
glare of the afternoon sunshine, with her knees
drawn up to her chin, and her brown eyes
following eagerly the pathway by the river
where she has ridden with Dick no later than
this morning. This morning!&mdash;to waiting Ruby
it seems more like a century ago.</p>

<p>Jenny finds her there when she has washed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
up the dinner dishes, tidied all for the afternoon,
and come out to get what she expresses as a
&#8220;breath o&#8217; caller air,&#8221; after her exertions of the
day. The &#8220;breath o&#8217; air&#8221; Jenny may get;
but it will never be &#8220;caller&#8221; nor anything approaching
&#8220;caller&#8221; at this season of the year.
Poor Jenny, she may well sigh for the fresh
moorland breezes of bonnie Scotland with its
shady glens, where the bracken and wild
hyacinth grow, and where the very plash of the
mountain torrent or &#8220;sough&#8221; of the wind among
the trees, makes one feel cool, however hot and
sultry it may be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;re no cryin&#8217;, Miss Ruby?&#8221; ejaculates
Jenny. &#8220;No but that the heat o&#8217; this outlandish
place would gar anybody cry. What&#8217;s wrong
wi&#8217; ye, ma lambie?&#8221; Jenny can be very gentle
upon occasion. &#8220;Are ye no weel?&#8221; For all
her six years of residence in the bush, Jenny&#8217;s
Scotch tongue is still aggressively Scotch.</p>

<p>Ruby raises a face in which tears and smiles
struggle hard for mastery.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not crying, <i>really</i>, Jenny,&#8221; she answers.
&#8220;Only,&#8221; with a suspicious droop of the dark-fringed
eye-lids and at the corners of the rosy
mouth, &#8220;I was pretty near it. It&#8217;s dad. I <i>do</i>
wish he was home. I can&#8217;t help watching the
flames, and thinking that something might perhaps
be happening to him, and me not there
to know. And then I began to feel glad to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
think how nice it would be to see him and Dick
come riding home. Oh! Jenny, how <i>do</i> little
girls get along who have no father?&#8221;</p>

<p>It is strange that Ruby never reflects that
her own mother has gone from her. All her
love is centred in dad.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Lord A&#8217;mighty tak&#8217;s care o&#8217; such,&#8221;
Jenny responds solemnly. &#8220;Ye&#8217;ll just weary
your eyes glowerin&#8217; awa&#8217; at the fire like that,
Miss Ruby. They say that &#8216;a watched pot
never boils,&#8217; an&#8217; I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; your papa&#8217;ll no
come a meenit suner for a&#8217; your watchin&#8217;.
Gae in an&#8217; rest yersel&#8217; like the mistress. She&#8217;s
sleepin&#8217; finely on the sofa.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruby gives a little impatient wriggle. &#8220;How
can I, Jenny,&#8221; she exclaims piteously, &#8220;when
dad&#8217;s out there? Oh! I don&#8217;t know whatever
I would do if anything was to happen to dad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pit yer trust in the Lord, ma dearie,&#8221; the
Scotchwoman says reverently. &#8220;Ye&#8217;ll be in
richt gude keepin&#8217; then, an&#8217; them ye love as
weel.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ruby only wriggles again. She does
not want Jenny&#8217;s solemn talk. It is dad she
desires. Dad, whom she loves so dearly, and
whose little daughter&#8217;s heart would surely break
if aught of ill befell him.</p>

<p>So the long, long afternoon wears away, and
when is an afternoon so tedious as when one is
eagerly waiting for something or some one?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Jenny goes indoors again, and Ruby can hear
the clatter of plates and cups echoing across
the quadrangle as she makes ready the early
tea. The child&#8217;s eyes are dim with the glare
at which she has so long been gazing, and her
limbs, in their cramped position, are aching;
but Ruby hardly seems to feel the discomfort
from which those useful members suffer. She
goes in to tea with a grudge, listens to her stepmother&#8217;s
fretful little complaints with an absent
air which shows how far away her heart is, and
returns as soon as she may to her point of
vantage. &#8220;Oh, me!&#8221; sighs the poor little girl.
&#8220;Will he never come?&#8221;</p>

<p>Out in the west the red sun is dying grandly
in an amber sky, tinged with the glory of his
life-blood, when dad at length comes riding
home. Ruby has seen him far in the distance,
and runs out past the gate to meet him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dad darling!&#8221; she cries. &#8220;I did think
you were never coming. Oh, dad, are you
hurt?&#8221; her quick eyes catching sight of his
hand in a sling.</p>

<p>Her father laughs. &#8220;Only a scratch, little
girl,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Don&#8217;t frighten the mother
about it. Poor little Ruby red, were you
frightened? Did you think your old father was
to be killed outright?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; Ruby says. Her eyes are
shining now. &#8220;And mamma was frightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
too. And when even Dick didn&#8217;t come back.
Oh, dad, wasn&#8217;t it just dreadful&mdash;the fire, I
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>Black Prince has been put into the paddock,
and Ruby goes into the house, hanging on her
father&#8217;s uninjured arm. The child&#8217;s heart has
grown suddenly light. The terrible fear which
has been weighing her down for the last few
hours has been lifted, and Ruby is her old
joyous self again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad,&#8221; the little girl says later on. They
are sitting out on the verandah, enjoying the
comparative cool of the evening. &#8220;What will
he do, old Davis, I mean, now that his house
is burnt down? It won&#8217;t hardly be worth
while his building another, now that he&#8217;s
so old.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dad does not answer just for a moment, and
Ruby, glancing quickly upwards, almost fancies
that her father must be angry with her; his
face is so very grave. Perhaps he does not
even wish her to mention the name of the old
man, who, but that he is &#8220;so old,&#8221; should now
have been in prison.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Davis will never need another house
now, Ruby,&#8221; Dad answers, looking down into
the eager little upturned face. &#8220;He has gone
away. God has taken him away, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dead?&#8221; Ruby questions with wide-open,
horror-stricken eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>The little girl hardly hears her father as he
goes on to tell her how the old man&#8217;s end
came, suddenly and without warning, crushing
him in the ruins of his burning cottage, where
the desolate creature died as he had lived, uncared
for and alone. Into Ruby&#8217;s heart a great,
sorrowful regret has come, regret for a kind act
left for ever undone, a kind word for ever unspoken.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I can never do it now!&#8221; the child sobs.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll never even know I wanted to be kind
to him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kind to whom, little girl?&#8221; her father asks
wonderingly.</p>

<p>And it is in those kind arms that Ruby sobs
out her story. &#8220;I can never do it now!&#8221; that
is the burden of her sorrow.</p>

<p>The late Australian twilight gathers round
them, and the stars twinkle out one by one.
But, far away in the heaven which is beyond
the stars and the dim twilight of this world, I
think that God knows how one little girl, whose
eyes are now dim with tears, tried to be &#8220;kind,&#8221;
and it may be that in His own good time&mdash;and
God&#8217;s time is always the best&mdash;He will let old
Davis &#8220;know&#8221; also.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">RUBY goes about her work and play
very gravely for the next few days.
A great sorrow sits at her heart
which only time can lighten and
chase away. She is very lonely, this little girl&mdash;lonely
without even knowing it, but none the
less to be pitied on that account. To her
step-mother Ruby never even dreams of turning
for comfort or advice in her small troubles and
griefs. Dad is his little girl&#8217;s <i>confidant</i>; but,
then, dad is often away, and in Mrs. Thorne&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
presence Ruby never thinks of confiding in
her father.</p>

<p>It is a hot sunny morning in the early months
of the new year. Ruby is riding by her father&#8217;s
side along the river&#8217;s bank, Black Prince doing
his very best to accommodate his long steps to
Smuttie&#8217;s slower amble. Far over the long flats
of uncultivated bush-land hangs a soft blue haze,
forerunner of a day of intense heat. But Ruby
and dad are early astir this morning, and it is
still cool and fresh with the beautiful young freshness
of a glorious summer morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s lovely just now,&#8221; Ruby says, with a little
sigh of satisfaction. &#8220;I wish it would always
stay early morning; don&#8217;t you, dad? It&#8217;s like
where it says in the hymn about &#8216;the summer
morn I&#8217;ve sighed for.&#8217; P&#8217;raps that means that
it will always be morning in heaven. I hope it
will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be a very fair summer morn anyway,
little girl,&#8221; says dad, a sudden far-away look
coming into his brown eyes.</p>

<p>At the child&#8217;s words, his thoughts have gone
back with a sudden rush of memory to another
summer&#8217;s morning, long, long ago, when he knelt
by the bedside where his young wife lay gasping
out her life, and watched Ruby&#8217;s mother go
home to God. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be waiting for you, Will,&#8221;
she had whispered only a little while before she
went away. &#8220;It won&#8217;t be so very long, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
darling; for even heaven won&#8217;t be quite heaven
to me with you away.&#8221; And as the dawning
rose over the purple hill-tops, and the birds&#8217; soft
twitter-twitter gave glad greeting to the new-born
day, the angels had come for Ruby&#8217;s
mother, and the dawning for her had been the
glorious dawning of heaven.</p>

<p>Many a year has passed away since then,
sorrowfully enough at first for the desolate husband,
all unheeded by the child, who never
missed her mother because she never knew
her. Nowadays new hopes, new interests
have come to Will Thorne, dimming with their
fresher links the dear old days of long ago.
He has not forgotten the love of his youth,
never will; but time has softened the bitterness
of his sorrow, and caused him to think but with
a gentle regret of the woman whom God had
called away in the suntime of her youth. But
Ruby&#8217;s words have come to him this summer
morning awakening old memories long slumbering,
and his thoughts wander from the dear old
days, up&mdash;up&mdash;up to God&#8217;s land on high, where,
in the fair summer morning of Paradise, one is
waiting longingly, hopefully&mdash;one who, even up
in heaven, will be bitterly disappointed if those
who in the old days she loved more than life
itself will not one day join her there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad,&#8221; Ruby asks quickly, uplifting a troubled
little face to that other dear one above her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
&#8220;what is the matter? You looked so sorry, so
very sorry, just now,&#8221; adds the little girl, with
something almost like a sob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry. Did I?&#8221; says the father, with a swift
sudden smile. He bends down to the little
figure riding by his side, and strokes the soft,
brown hair. &#8220;I was thinking of your mother,
Ruby,&#8221; dad says. &#8220;But instead of looking
sorry I should have looked glad, that for her
all tears are for ever past, and that nothing
can ever harm her now. I was thinking of her
at heaven&#8217;s gate, darling, watching, as she said
she would, for you and for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; says Ruby, with very thoughtful
brown eyes, &#8220;how will I know her? And
how will she know me, dad? God will have
to tell her, won&#8217;t He? And p&#8217;raps I&#8217;ll be quite
grown up &#8217;fore I die, and mother won&#8217;t think
it&#8217;s her own little Ruby at all. I wish I knew,&#8221;
adds the child, in a puzzled voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;God will make it all right, dear. I have
no fear of that,&#8221; says the father, quickly.</p>

<p>It is not often that Ruby and he talk as
they are doing now. Like all true Scotchmen,
he is reticent by nature, reverencing that
which is holy too much to take it lightly upon
his lips. As for Ruby, she has never even
thought of such things. In her gay, sunny
life she has had no time to think of the
mother awaiting her coming in the land which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
to Ruby, in more senses than one, is &#8220;very
far off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Far in the distance the early sunshine gleams
on the river, winding out and in like a silver
thread. The tall trees stand stiffly by its banks,
their green leaves faintly rustling in the soft
summer wind. And above all stretches the
blue, blue sky, flecked here and there by a
fleecy cloud, beyond which, as the children tell
us, lies God&#8217;s happiest land.</p>

<p>It is a fair scene, and one which Ruby&#8217;s eyes
have gazed on often, with but little thought or
appreciation of its beauty. But to-day her
thoughts are far away, beyond another river
which all must pass, where the shadows only
fall the deeper because of the exceeding brightness
of the light beyond. And still another
river rises before the little girl&#8217;s eyes, a river,
clear as crystal, the &#8220;beautiful, beautiful river&#8221;
by whose banks the pilgrimage of even the
most weary shall one day cease, the burden
of even the most heavy-laden, one day be
laid down. On what beauties must not her
mother&#8217;s eyes be now gazing! But even midst
the joy and glory of the heavenly land, how
can that fond, loving heart be quite content
if Ruby, one far day, is not to be with her
there?</p>

<p>All the way home the little girl is very
thoughtful, and a strange quietness seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
hang over usually merry Ruby for the remainder
of the day.</p>

<p>But towards evening a great surprise is in
store for her. Dick, whose duty it is, when his
master is otherwise engaged, to ride to the
nearest post-town for the letters, arrives with a
parcel in his bag, addressed in very big letters
to &#8220;Miss Ruby Thorne.&#8221; With fingers trembling
with excitement the child cuts the string.
Within is a long white box, and within the
box a doll more beautiful than Ruby has ever
even imagined, a doll with golden curls and
closed eyes, who, when set upright, discloses
the bluest of blue orbs. She is dressed in the
daintiest of pale blue silk frocks, and tiny bronze
shoes encase her feet. She is altogether, as
Ruby ecstatically exclaims, &#8220;a love of a doll,&#8221;
and seems but little the worse for her long
journey across the briny ocean.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s from Jack!&#8221; cries Ruby, her eyes shining.
&#8220;Oh, and here&#8217;s a letter pinned to dolly&#8217;s dress!
What a nice writer he is!&#8221; The child&#8217;s cheeks
flush redly, and her fingers tremble even more
as she tears the envelope open. &#8220;I&#8217;ll read it
first to myself, mamma, and then I&#8217;ll give it
to you.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#8220;<span class="smcap">My dear Little Ruby</span>&#8221; (so the letter runs),<br />
</p>

<p>&#8220;I have very often thought of you
since last we parted, and now do myself the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
pleasure of sending madam across the sea in
charge of my letter to you. She is the little
bird I would ask to whisper of me to you now and
again, and if you remember your old friend as
well as he will always remember you, I shall
ask no more. How are the dollies? Bluebell
and her other ladyship&mdash;I have forgotten her
name. I often think of you this bleak, cold
weather, and envy you your Australian sunshine
just as, I suppose, you often envy me my
bonnie Scotland. I am looking forward to the
day when you are coming home on that visit
you spoke of. We must try and have a regular
jollification then, and Edinburgh, your mother&#8217;s
home, isn&#8217;t so far off from Greenock but that
you can manage to spend some time with us.
My mother bids me say that she will expect
you and your people. Give my kindest regards
to your father and mother, and, looking forward
to next Christmas,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="gap1">&#8220;I remain, my dear little Ruby red,</span><br />

<span class="gap2">&#8220;Your old friend,</span><br />

&#8220;<span class="smcap">Jack</span>.&#8221;<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Very good of him to take so much trouble
on a little girl&#8217;s account,&#8221; remarks Mrs. Thorne,
approvingly, when she too has perused the
letter. &#8220;And what an exquisite doll! You must
certainly write and thank Mr. Kirke, Ruby.
It is the least you can do, after his kindness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
and I am sure he would like to have a letter
from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I just love him,&#8221; says Ruby, squeezing her
doll closer to her. &#8220;I wish I could call the
doll after him; but then, &#8216;Jack&#8217; would never do
for a lady&#8217;s name. I know what I&#8217;ll do!&#8221; with
a little dance of delight. &#8220;I&#8217;ll call her &#8216;May&#8217;
after the little girl who gave Jack the card, and
I&#8217;ll call her &#8216;Kirke&#8217; for her second name, and
that&#8217;ll be after Jack. I&#8217;ll tell him that when I
write, and I&#8217;d better send him back his card
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>That very evening, Ruby sits down to
laboriously compose a letter to her friend.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&#8220;<span class="smcap">My dear Jack</span>&#8221; (writes Ruby in her large
round hand),</p>

<p>[&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what else to say,&#8221; murmurs
the little girl, pausing with her pen uplifted.
&#8220;I never wrote a letter before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank him for the doll, of course,&#8221; advises
Mrs. Thorne, with an amused smile. &#8220;That is
the reason for your writing to him at all, Ruby.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Ruby, thus adjured, proceeds&mdash;]</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you very much for the doll. She
is just a lovely doll. I am calling her &#8216;May
Kirke,&#8217; after the name on your card, and after
your own name; because I couldn&#8217;t call her
&#8216;Jack.&#8217; We are having very hot weather yet;
but not so hot as when you were here. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
dolls are not quite well, because Fanny fell
under old Hans&#8217; waggon, and the waggon went
over her face and squashed it. I am very sorry,
because I liked her, but your doll will make up.
Thank you for writing me. Mamma says I am
to send her kindest regards to you. It won&#8217;t
be long till next Christmas now. I am sending
you back your card.</p>

<p class="gap">
&#8220;With love, from your little friend,</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Ruby</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;P.S.&mdash;Dad has come in now, and asks me
to remember him to you. I have had to write
this all over again; mamma said it was so
badly spelt.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Jack Kirke&#8217;s eyes soften as he reads the
badly written little letter, and it is noticeable
that when he reaches a certain point where two
words, &#8220;May Kirke,&#8221; appear, he stops and
kisses the paper on which they are written.</p>

<p>Such are the excessively foolish antics of
young men who happen to be in love.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">CHRISTMAS DAY again; but a
white, white Christmas this time&mdash;a
Christmas Day in bonnie Scotland.</p>

<p>In the sitting-room of an old-fashioned
house in Edinburgh a little brown-haired,
brown-eyed girl is dancing about in an
immense state of excitement. She is a merry-looking
little creature, with rosy cheeks, and
wears a scarlet frock, which sets off those same
cheeks to perfection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you be still even for a moment,
Ruby?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t,&#8221; the child returns. &#8220;And
neither could you, Aunt Lena, if you knew
my dear Jack. Oh, he&#8217;s just a dear! I
wonder what&#8217;s keeping him? What if he&#8217;s just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
gone on straight home to Greenock without
stopping here at all. Oh dear! what if there&#8217;s
been a collision. Dad says there are quite often
collisions in Scotland!&#8221; cries Ruby, suddenly
growing very grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;What if the skies were to fall? Just about
as probable, you wild little Australian,&#8221; laughs
the lady addressed as Aunt Lena, who bears
sufficient resemblance to the present Mrs. Thorne
to proclaim them to be sisters. &#8220;You must
expect trains to be late at Christmas time,
Ruby. But of course you can&#8217;t be expected to
know that, living in the Australian bush all
your days. Poor, dear Dolly, I wonder how
she ever survived it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mamma was very often ill,&#8221; Ruby returns
very gravely. &#8220;She didn&#8217;t like being out there at
all, compared with Scotland. &#8216;Bonnie Scotland&#8217;
Jenny always used to call it. But I do think,&#8221;
adds the child, with a small sigh and shiver
as she glances out at the fast-falling snow,
&#8220;that Glengarry&#8217;s bonnier. There are so many
houses here, and you can&#8217;t see the river unless
you go away up above them all. P&#8217;raps though
in summer,&#8221; with a sudden regret that she has
possibly said something not just quite polite.
&#8220;And then when grandma and you are always
used to it. It&#8217;s different with me; I&#8217;ve been
always used to Glengarry. Oh,&#8221; cries Ruby,
with a sudden, glad little cry, and dash to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the front door, &#8220;here he is at last! Oh,
Jack, Jack!&#8221; Aunt Lena can hear the shrill
childish voice exclaiming. &#8220;I thought you
were just never coming. I thought p&#8217;raps
there had been a collision.&#8221; And presently the
dining-room door is flung open, and Ruby,
now in a high state of excitement, ushers in her
friend.</p>

<p>Miss Lena Templeton&#8217;s first feeling is one of
surprise, almost of disappointment, as she rises
to greet the new-comer. The &#8220;Jack&#8221; Ruby
had talked of in such ecstatic terms had presented
himself before the lady&#8217;s mind&#8217;s eye as
a tall, broad-shouldered, handsome man, the
sort of man likely to take a child&#8217;s fancy; ay,
and a woman&#8217;s too.</p>

<p>But the real Jack is insignificant in the
extreme. At such a man one would not bestow
more than a passing glance. So thinks Miss
Templeton as her hand is taken in the young
Scotchman&#8217;s strong grasp. His face, now that
the becoming bronze of travel has left it, is
colourlessly pale, his merely medium height
lessened by his slightly stooping form. Ay,
but his eyes! It is his eyes which suddenly
and irresistibly fascinate Miss Lena, seeming
to look her through and through, and when Jack
smiles, this young lady who has turned more
than one kneeling suitor from her feet with a
coldly-spoken &#8220;no,&#8221; ceases to wonder how even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
the child has been fascinated by the wonderful
personality of this plain-faced man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very glad to make your acquaintance,
Miss Templeton,&#8221; Jack Kirke says. &#8220;It is good
of you to receive me for Ruby&#8217;s sake.&#8221; He
glances down at the child with one of his swift,
bright smiles, and squeezes tighter the little
hand which so confidingly clasps his.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told Aunt Lena all about you, Jack,&#8221;
Ruby proclaims in her shrill sweet voice. &#8220;She
said she was quite anxious to see you after
all I had said. Oh! Jack, can&#8217;t you stay
Christmas with us? It would be lovely if you
could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall be very glad if you can make
it convenient to stay and eat your Christmas
dinner with us, Mr. Kirke,&#8221; Miss Templeton
says. &#8220;In such weather as this, you have every
excuse for postponing your journey to Greenock
for a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Many thanks for your kindness, Miss
Templeton,&#8221; the young man responds. &#8220;I
should have been most happy, but that I am
due at Greenock this afternoon at my mother&#8217;s.
She is foolish enough to set great store by her
unworthy son, and I couldn&#8217;t let her have the
dismal cheer of eating her Christmas dinner all
alone. Two years ago,&#8221; the young fellow&#8217;s voice
softens as he speaks, &#8220;there were two of us.
Nowadays I must be more to my mother than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
I ever was, to make up for Wat. He was my
only brother&#8221;&mdash;all the agony of loss contained in
that &#8220;was&#8221; no one but Jack Kirke himself will
ever know&mdash;&#8220;and it is little more than a year
now since he died. My poor mother, I don&#8217;t
know how I had the heart to leave her alone
last Christmas as I did; but I think I was nearly
out of my mind at the time. Anyway I must try to
make it up to her this year, if I possibly can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was Wat like you?&#8221; Ruby asks very
softly. She has climbed on her long-lost
friend&#8217;s knee, a habit Ruby has not yet grown
big enough to be ashamed of, and sits, gazing
up into those other brown eyes. &#8220;I wish I&#8217;d
known him too,&#8221; Ruby says.</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand times better,&#8221; Wat&#8217;s brother
returns with decision. &#8220;He was the kindest
fellow that ever lived, I think, though it seems
queer to be praising up one&#8217;s own brother.
If you had known Wat, Ruby, I would have
been nowhere, and glad to be nowhere, alongside
of such a fellow as him. Folks said we
were like in a way, to look at; though it was
a poor compliment to Wat to say so; but
there the resemblance ended. This is his
photograph,&#8221; rummaging his pocket-book&mdash;&#8220;no,
not that one, old lady,&#8221; a trifle hurriedly, as one
falls to the ground.</p>

<p>Ruby clambers down to pick it up. &#8220;Mayn&#8217;t
I see it, Jack?&#8221; she petitions.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>Jack Kirke grows rather red and looks a
trifle foolish; but it is impossible to refuse the
child&#8217;s request. Had Ruby&#8217;s aunt not been
present, it is possible that he might not have
minded quite so much.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like her face,&#8221; Ruby determines. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
nice face.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is a nice face, this on the photograph, as
the child has said. The face of a girl just
stepping into womanhood, fair and sweet,
though perhaps a trifle dreamy, but with that
shining in the eyes which tells how to their
owner belongs a gift which but few understand,
and which, for lack of a better name, the world
terms &#8220;Imagination.&#8221; For those who possess it
there will ever be an added glory in the sunset,
a softly-whispered story in each strain of soon-to-be-forgotten
music, a reflection of God&#8217;s radiance
upon the very meanest things of this earth.
A gift which through all life will make for them
all joy keener, all sorrow bitterer, and which they
only who have it can fully comprehend and
understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;And this is Wat,&#8221; goes on Jack, thus
effectually silencing the question which he sees
hovering on Ruby&#8217;s lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like him, too,&#8221; Ruby cries, with shining
eyes. &#8220;Look, Aunt Lena, isn&#8217;t he nice?
Doesn&#8217;t he look nice and kind?&#8221;</p>

<p>There is just the faintest resemblance to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
living brother in the pictured face upon the card,
for in his day Walter Kirke must indeed have
been a handsome man. But about the whole
face a tinge of sadness rests. In the far-away
land of heaven God has wiped away all tears
for ever from the eyes of Jack&#8217;s brother. In
His likeness Walter Kirke has awakened, and is
satisfied for ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do, Mr. Kirke?&#8221; says Ruby&#8217;s
mother, fluttering into the room. Nowadays
Mrs. Thorne is a very different woman from the
languid invalid of the Glengarry days. The
excitement and bustle of town life have done
much to bring back her accustomed spirits, and
she looks more like pretty Dolly Templeton of
the old days than she has done since her
marriage. &#8220;Will is just coming. We have been
out calling on a few friends, and got detained.
Isn&#8217;t it a regular Christmas day? I hope that
you will be able to spend some time with us,
now that you are here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have just been telling Miss Templeton that
I have promised to eat my Christmas dinner in
Greenock,&#8221; Jack Kirke returns, with a smile.
&#8220;Business took me north, or I shouldn&#8217;t have
been away from home in such weather as this,
and I thought it would be a good plan to break
my journey in Edinburgh, and see how my
Australian friends were getting on. My mother
intends writing you herself; but she bids me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
say that if you can spare a few days for us in
Greenock, we shall be more than pleased. I
rather suspect, Ruby, that she has heard so
much of you, that she is desirous of making
your acquaintance on her own account, and
discovering what sort of young lady it is
who has taken her son&#8217;s heart so completely
by storm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, and, Jack,&#8221; cries Ruby, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got
May with me. Your dolly, you know. I
thought it would be nice to let her see bonnie
Scotland again, seeing she came from it, just
as I did when I was ever so little. Can&#8217;t I
bring her to Greenock when I come? Because,
seeing she is called after you, she ought really
and truly to come and visit you. Oughtn&#8217;t
she?&#8221; questions Ruby, looking up into the
face of May&#8217;s donor with very wide brown
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Jack returns gravely. &#8220;It would
never do to leave May behind in Edinburgh.&#8221;
He lingers over the name almost lovingly; but
Ruby does not notice that then.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad,&#8221; Ruby cries as her father comes into
the room, &#8220;do you know what? We&#8217;re all to
go to Greenock to stay with Jack. Isn&#8217;t it
lovely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very flattering to us that you are in
such a hurry to get away from us, Ruby,&#8221;
observes Miss Templeton, with a slight smile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
&#8220;Whatever else you have accomplished, Mr.
Kirke, you seem to have stolen one young
lady&#8217;s heart at least away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like him,&#8221; murmurs Ruby, stroking Jack&#8217;s
hair in rather a babyish way she has. &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t like never to go back to Glengarry,
because I like Glengarry; but <i>I should</i> like to
stay always in Scotland because Jack&#8217;s here.&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;JACK,&#8221; Ruby says very soberly, &#8220;I
want you to do something for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crowning joy has come at last
to Ruby. Mrs. Kirke&#8217;s expected
letter, backed by another from her son, has
come, inviting the Thornes to spend the first
week of the New Year with them. And now
Ruby&#8217;s parents have departed to pay some
flying visits farther north, leaving their little
girl, at Mrs. Kirke&#8217;s urgent request, to await
their return in Greenock.</p>

<p>&#8220;For Jack&#8217;s sake I should be so glad if you
could allow her,&#8221; Jack&#8217;s mother had said. &#8220;It
makes everything so bright to have a child&#8217;s
presence in the house, and Jack and I have
been sad enough since Walter died.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>Sad enough! Ay, in all truth so they had.
Few but Jack could have told how sad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire away, little Ruby red,&#8221; is Jack&#8217;s
rejoinder.</p>

<p>They are in the smoking-room, Jack stretched
in one easy chair, Ruby curled up in another.
Jack has been away in dreamland, following
with his eyes the blue wreaths of smoke floating
upwards from his pipe to the roof; but now he
comes back to real life&mdash;and Ruby.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is it,&#8221; Ruby explains. &#8220;You know the
day we went down to Inverkip, dad and I?
Well, we went to see mamma&#8217;s grave&mdash;my own
mamma, I mean. Dad gave me a shilling before
he went away, and I thought I should like to
buy some flowers and put them there. It
looked so lonely, and as if everybody had forgotten
all about her being buried there. And
she was my own mamma,&#8221; adds the little girl,
a world of pathos in her young voice. &#8220;So
there&#8217;s nobody but me to do it. So, Jack,
would you mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Taking you?&#8221; exclaims the young man.
&#8220;Of course I will, old lady. It&#8217;ll be a jolly
little excursion, just you and I together. No,
not exactly jolly,&#8221; remembering the intent of
their journey, &#8220;but very nice. We&#8217;ll go to-morrow,
Ruby. Luckily the yard&#8217;s having
holidays just now, so I can do as I like.
As for the flowers, don&#8217;t you bother about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
them. I&#8217;ll get plenty for you to do as you like
with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you are good!&#8221; cries the little girl,
rising and throwing her arms round the young
man&#8217;s neck. &#8220;I wish you weren&#8217;t so old, Jack,
and I&#8217;d marry you when I grew up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m desperately old,&#8221; says Jack, showing
all his pretty, even, white teeth in a smile.
&#8220;Twenty-six if I&#8217;m a day. I shall be quite an
old fogey when you&#8217;re a nice young lady, Ruby
red. Thank you all the same for the honour,&#8221;
says Jack, twirling his moustache and smiling
to himself a little. &#8220;But you&#8217;ll find some
nice young squatter in the days to come who&#8217;ll
have two words to say to such an arrangement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t ever like anybody so well as you,
anyway,&#8221; decides Ruby, resolutely. In the
days to come Jack often laughingly recalls this
asseveration to her. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll
ever get married. I wouldn&#8217;t like to leave
dad.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following day sees a young man and a
child passing through the quaint little village of
Inverkip, lying about six miles away from the
busy seaport of Greenock, on their way to the
quiet churchyard which encircles the little
parish kirk. As Ruby has said, it looks painfully
lonely this winter afternoon, none the less
so that the rain and thaw have come and swept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
before them the snow, save where it lies in discoloured
patches here and there about the
churchyard wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it by the tombstone,&#8221; observes Ruby,
cheerfully, as they close the gates behind them.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a grey tombstone, and mamma&#8217;s name
below a lot of others. This is it, I think,&#8221; adds
the child, pausing before a rather desolate-looking
grey slab. &#8220;Yes, there&#8217;s her name at
the foot, &#8216;Janet Stuart,&#8217; and dad says that was
her favourite text that&#8217;s underneath&mdash;&#8216;Surely
I come quickly. Amen. Even so come, Lord
Jesus.&#8217; I&#8217;ll put down the flowers. I wonder,&#8221;
says Ruby, looking up into Jack&#8217;s face with a
sudden glad wonder on her own, &#8220;if mamma
can look down from heaven, and see you and
me here, and be glad that somebody&#8217;s putting
flowers on her grave at last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She will have other things to be glad about,
I think, little Ruby,&#8221; Jack Kirke says very
gently. &#8220;But she will be glad, I am sure, if
she sees us&mdash;and I think she does,&#8221; the young
man adds reverently&mdash;&#8220;that through all those
years her little girl has not forgotten her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t remember her,&#8221; says Ruby, looking
up with puzzled eyes. &#8220;Only dad says that
before she died she said that he was to tell me
that she would be waiting for me, and that she
had prayed the Lord Jesus that I might be one
of His jewels. And I&#8217;m not! I&#8217;m not!&#8221; cries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Ruby, with a little choke in her voice. &#8220;And
if I&#8217;m not, the Lord Jesus will never gather me,
and I&#8217;ll never see my mamma again. Even up
in heaven she might p&#8217;raps feel sorry if some
day I wasn&#8217;t there too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Jack says quickly. He puts his
arm about the little girl&#8217;s shoulders, and his own
heart goes out in a great leap to this child who
is wondering, as he himself not so very long
ago, in a strange mazed way, wondered too, if
even &#8217;midst heaven&#8217;s glories another will &#8220;feel
sorry&#8221; because those left behind will not one far
day join them there. &#8220;I felt that too,&#8221; the young
man goes on quietly. &#8220;But it&#8217;s all right now,
dear little Ruby red. Everything seemed so
dark when Wat died, and I cried out in my
misery that the God who could let such things
be was no God for me. But bit by bit, after
a terrible time of doubt, the mists lifted, and
God seemed to let me know that He had done
the very best possible for Wat in taking him
away, though I couldn&#8217;t understand just yet why.
The one thing left for me to do now was to
make quite sure that one day I should meet
Wat again, and I couldn&#8217;t rest till I made sure
of that. It&#8217;s so simple, Ruby, just to believe in
the dear Lord Jesus, so simple, that when at
last I found out about it, I wondered how I
could have doubted so long. I can&#8217;t speak
about such things,&#8221; the young fellow adds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
huskily, &#8220;but I felt that if you feel about your
mother as I did about Wat, that I must help
you. Don&#8217;t you see, dear, just to trust in Christ
with all your heart that He is able to save you,
and He <i>will</i>. It was only for Wat&#8217;s sake that
I tried to love Him first; but now I love Him
for His own.&#8221;</p>

<p>It has cost Ruby&#8217;s friend more than the child
knows to make even this simple confession of
his faith. But I think that in heaven&#8217;s morning
Jack&#8217;s crown will be all the brighter for the
words he spoke to a doubting little girl on a
never-to-be-forgotten winter&#8217;s day. For it is
said that even those who but give to drink of a
cup of cold water for the dear Christ&#8217;s sake shall
in no wise lose their reward.</p>

<p>&#8220;I love you, Jack,&#8221; is all Ruby says, with a
squeeze of her friend&#8217;s hand. &#8220;And if I do
see mamma in heaven some day, I&#8217;ll tell her
how good you&#8217;ve been to me. Oh! Jack, won&#8217;t
it be nice if we&#8217;re all there together, Wat and
you, and dad and mamma and me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack does not answer just for a moment.
The young fellow&#8217;s heart has gone out with
one of those sudden agonizing rushes of longing
to the brother whom he has loved, ay, and
still loves, more than life itself. It <i>must</i> be
better for Wat&mdash;of that Jack with all his loyal
heart feels sure; but oh, how desolately empty
is the world to the brother Jack left behind!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
One far day God will let they two meet again;
that too Jack knows; but oh, for one hour of
the dear old here and now! In the golden
streets of the new Jerusalem Jack will look
into the sorrowless eyes of one whom God
has placed for ever above all trouble, sorrow,
and pain; but the lad&#8217;s heart cries out with
a fierce yearning for no glorified spirit with
crown-decked brow, but the dear old Wat
with the leal home love shining out of his eyes,
and the warm hand-clasp of brotherly affection.
Fairer than all earthly music the song of the
redeemed may ring throughout the courts of
heaven; but sweeter far in those fond ears will
sound the well-loved tones which Jack Kirke
has known since he was a child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear,&#8221; Jack says, with a swift, sudden
smile for the eager little face uplifted to his, &#8220;it
<i>will</i> be nice. So we must make sure that we
won&#8217;t disappoint them, mustn&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>Another face than Ruby&#8217;s uprises before the
young man&#8217;s eyes as he speaks, the face of the
brother whose going had made all the difference
to Jack&#8217;s life; but who, up in heaven, had
brought him nearer to God than he ever could
have done on earth. Not a dead face, as Jack
had looked his last upon it, but bright and loving
as in the dear old days when the world seemed
made for those two, who dreamed such great
things of the wonderful &#8220;may be&#8221; to come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
But now God has raised Wat higher than even
his airy castles have ever reached&mdash;to heaven
itself, and brought Jack, by the agony of loss,
very near unto Himself. No, Jack determines,
he must make sure that he will never disappoint
Wat.</p>

<p>The red sun, like a ball of fire, is setting
behind the dark, leafless tree-tops when at last
they turn to go, and everything is very still,
save for the faint ripple of the burn through
the long flats of field as it flows out to meet
the sea. Fast clasped in Jack&#8217;s is Ruby&#8217;s little
hand; but a stronger arm than his is guiding
both Jack and Ruby onward. In the dawning,
neither Wat nor Ruby&#8217;s mother need fear disappointment
now.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I came,&#8221; says Ruby in a very
quiet little voice as the train goes whizzing
home. &#8220;There was nobody to come but me,
you see, me and dad, for dad says that mamma
had no relations when he married her. They
were all dead, and she had to be a governess to
keep herself. Dad says that he never saw any
one so brave as my own mamma was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See and grow up like her, then, little Ruby,&#8221;
Jack says with one of his bright, kindly smiles.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the best sight in the world to see a brave
woman; at least <i>I</i> think so,&#8221; adds the young
man, smiling down into the big brown eyes
looking up into his.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>He can hardly help marvelling, even to himself,
at the situation in which he now finds
himself. How Wat would have laughed in the
old days at the idea of Jack ever troubling
himself with a child, Jack, who had been best
known, if not exactly as a child-hater, at least
as a child-avoider. What has come over him
nowadays? Is it Wat&#8217;s mantle dropped from
the skies, the memory of that elder brother&#8217;s
kindly heart, which has softened the younger&#8217;s,
and made him &#8220;kind,&#8221; as Ruby one long
gone day had tried to be, to all whom he
comes in contact with? For Wat&#8217;s sake Jack
had first tried to do right; ay, but now it
is for a greater than that dear brother&#8217;s,
even for Christ&#8217;s. Like Mr. Valiant-for-Truth
of old renown, Wat has left as sword the
legacy of his great and beautiful charity to
the young brother who is to succeed him in
the pilgrimage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; Ruby whispers that evening as she
kisses her friend good night, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to
try&mdash;you know. I don&#8217;t want to disappoint
mamma.&#8221;</p>

<p>Up in heaven I wonder if the angels were glad
that night. God was, I know. And Jack.
There is an old, old verse ringing in my ears,
none the less true that he who spoke it in the
far away days has long since gone home to God:
&#8220;And they that be wise shall shine as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
brightness of the firmament, and they that turn
many to righteousness as the stars for ever and
ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Surely, in the dawning of that &#8220;summer
morn&#8221; Jack&#8217;s crown will not be a starless one.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">RUBY comes into the drawing-room
one afternoon to find the facsimile
of the photograph in Jack&#8217;s pocket-book
sitting with Mrs. Kirke there.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is our little Australian, May,&#8221; the
elder lady says, stretching out her hand to
Ruby. &#8220;Ruby, darling, this is Miss Leslie.
Perhaps Jack may have told you about her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do, dear?&#8221; Miss May Leslie
asks. She has a sweet, clear voice, and just
now does not look half so dreamy as in her
photograph, Ruby thinks. Her dark green
frock and black velvet hat with ostrich tips set
off her fair hair and delicately tinted face to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
perfection, and her blue eyes are shining as
she holds out her hand to the little girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen your photograph,&#8221; Ruby announces,
looking up into the sweet face above her. &#8220;It
fell out of Jack&#8217;s pocket-book one day. He
has it there with Wat&#8217;s. I&#8217;m going to give him
mine to carry there too; for Jack says he only
keeps the people he likes best in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie grows suddenly, and to Ruby it
seems unaccountably, as red as her own red frock.
But for all that the little girl cannot help thinking
that she does not look altogether ill-pleased.
Mrs. Kirke smiles in rather an embarrassed way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been long in Scotland, Ruby?&#8221;
the young lady questions, as though desirous
of changing the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;We came about the beginning of December,&#8221;
Ruby returns. And then she too puts rather
an irrelevant question: &#8220;Are you May?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes, I suppose I am May,&#8221; Miss
Leslie answers, laughing in spite of herself.
&#8220;But how did you know my name, Ruby?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack told her, I suppose. Was that it,
Ruby?&#8221; says Jack&#8217;s mother. &#8220;And this is a
child, May, who, when she is told a thing,
never forgets it. Isn&#8217;t that so, little girlie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but Jack didn&#8217;t tell me,&#8221; Ruby answers,
lifting wide eyes to her hostess. &#8220;I just guessed
that you must be May whenever I came in, and
then I heard auntie call you it.&#8221; For at Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Kirke&#8217;s own request, the little girl has conferred
upon her this familiar title. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a dolly
called after you,&#8221; goes on the child with sweet
candour. &#8220;May Kirke&#8217;s her name, and Jack
says it&#8217;s the prettiest name he ever heard, &#8216;May
Kirke,&#8217; I mean. For you see the dolly came
from Jack, and when I could only call her half
after him, I called her the other half after you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear little girl, how did you know my
name?&#8221; May asks in some amazement. Her eyes
are sparkling as she puts the question. No one
could accuse May Leslie of being dreamy now.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was on the card,&#8221; Ruby announces,
triumphantly. Well is it for Jack that he is
not at hand to hear all these disclosures. &#8220;Jack
left it behind him at Glengarry when he stayed
a night with us, and your name was on it.
Then I knew some other little girl must have
given it to Jack. I didn&#8217;t know then that she
would be big and grown-up like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ruby! Ruby! I am afraid that you are a
sad little tell-tale,&#8221; Mrs. Kirke says. It is rather
a sore point with her that this pink-and-white
girl should have slighted her only son so far as
to refuse his hand and heart. Poor Jack, he had
had more sorrows to bear than Walter&#8217;s death
when he left the land of his birth at that sad time.
In the fond mother&#8217;s eyes May is not half good
enough for her darling son; but May&#8217;s offence is
none the more to be condoned on that account.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>&#8220;I must really be going, Mrs. Kirke,&#8221; the
young lady says, rising. She cannot bear that
any more of Ruby&#8217;s revelations, however welcome
to her own ears, shall be made in the presence
of Jack&#8217;s mother. &#8220;I have inflicted quite a
visitation upon you as it is. You will come
and see me, darling, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; this to Ruby.
&#8220;Ask Mrs. Kirke if she will be so kind as to
bring you some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll bring May Kirke too,&#8221; Ruby cries.
It may have been the firelight which sends an
added redness to the other May&#8217;s cheeks, as
Ruby utters the name which Jack has said is
&#8220;the prettiest he has ever heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruby escorts her new-found friend down to
the hall door, issuing from which Miss Leslie
runs full tilt against a young man coming in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Jack,&#8221; Ruby cries, &#8220;you&#8217;re just in time!
Miss May&#8217;s just going away. I&#8217;ve forgotten her
other name, so I&#8217;m just going to call her Miss
May.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I see you home?&#8221; Jack Kirke asks.
&#8220;It is too dark now for you to go by yourself.&#8221;
He looks straight into the eyes of the girl he
has known since she was a child, the girl who
has refused his honest love because she had no
love to give in return, and May&#8217;s eyes fall
beneath his gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; she acquiesces meekly.</p>

<p>Ruby, looking out after the two as they go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
down the dark avenue, pities them for having to
go out on such a dismal night. The little girl does
not know that for them it is soon to be illumined
with a light than which there is none brighter save
that of heaven, the truest land of love.</p>

<p>It is rather a silent walk home, the conversation
made up of the most common of common-places&mdash;Jack
trying to steel himself against this
woman, whom, try as he will, he cannot thrust
out of his loyal heart; May tortured by that
most sorrowful of all loves, the love which came
too late; than which there is none sadder in this
grey old world to-day.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a nice little girl Ruby is,&#8221; says May at
length, trying to fill up a rather pitiful gap in the
conversation. &#8220;Your mother seems so fond of
her. I am sure she will miss her when she goes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s the dearest little girl in the world,&#8221;
Jack Kirke declares. His eyes involuntarily
meet May&#8217;s blue ones, and surely something
which was not there before is shining in their
violet depths&mdash;&#8220;except,&#8221; he says, then stops.
&#8220;May,&#8221; very softly, &#8220;will you let me say it?&#8221;</p>

<p>May answers nothing; but, though she droops
her head, Jack sees her eyes are shining. They
say that silence gives consent, and evidently
in this case it must have done so, or else the
young man in question chooses to translate it
in that way. So the stars smile down on an
old, old story, a story as old as the old, old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
world, and yet new and fresh as ever to those
who for the first time scan its wondrous pages;
a story than which there is none sweeter on
this side of time, the beautiful, glamorous mystery
of &#8220;love&#8217;s young dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And are you sure,&#8221; Jack asks after a time,
in the curious manner common to young lovers,
&#8220;that you really love me now, May? that I
shan&#8217;t wake up to find it all a mistake as it
was last time. I&#8217;m very dense at taking it in,
sweetheart; but it almost seems yet as though
it was too good to be true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite sure,&#8221; May says. She looks up into
the face of the man beside whom all others to
her are but &#8220;as shadows,&#8221; unalterable trust in
her blue eyes. &#8220;Jack,&#8221; very low, &#8220;I think I
have loved you all my life.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> said I would marry you, Jack,&#8221; Ruby
remarks in rather an offended voice when she
hears the news. &#8220;But I s&#8217;pose you thought I
was too little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was just it, Ruby red,&#8221; Jack tells her,
and stifles further remonstrance by a kiss.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
